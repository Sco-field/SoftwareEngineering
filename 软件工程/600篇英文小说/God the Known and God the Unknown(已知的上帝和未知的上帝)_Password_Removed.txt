Prefatory Note
"GOD the Known and God the Unknown" first appeared in the form
ofa series of articles which were published in "The Examiner" inMay, June,
and July, 1879.Samuel Butler subsequently revisedthe text of his work,
presumably with the intention ofrepublishing it, though he never carried
the intention intoeffect.In the present edition I have followed his
revisedversion almost without deviation.I have, however, retained afew
passages which Butler proposed to omit, partly because theyappear to me
to render the course of his argument clearer, andpartly because they
contain characteristic thoughts andexpressions of which none of his
admirers would wish to bedeprived.In the list of Butler's works "God the
Known and Godthe Unknown" follows "Life and Habit," which appeared
in 1877,and "Evolution, Old and New," which was published in May, 1879.
It is scarcely necessary to point out that the three works areclosely akin in
subject and treatment, and that "God the Knownand God the Unknown"
will gain in interest by being considered inrelation to its predecessors.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
MANKIND has ever been ready to discuss matters in the inverseratio
of their importance, so that the more closely a question isfelt to touch the
hearts of all of us, the more incumbent it isconsidered upon prudent people
to profess that it does not exist,to frown it down, to tell it to hold its
tongue, to maintain thatit has long been finally settled, so that there is now
noquestion concerning it.
So far, indeed, has this been carried through all time past thatthe
actions which are most important to us, such as our passagethrough the
embryonic stages, the circulation of our blood, ourrespiration, etc.etc.,
have long been formulated beyond allpower of reopening question
concerning them - the mere fact ormanner of their being done at all being
ranked among the greatdiscoveries of recent ages.Yet the analogy of past
settlementswould lead us to suppose that so much unanimity was not
arrivedat all at once, but rather that it must have been preceded bymuch
smouldering [sic] discontent, which again was followed byopen warfare;
and that even after a settlement had beenostensibly arrived at, there was
still much secret want ofconviction on the part of many for several
generations.
There are many who see nothing in this tendency of our nature
butoccasion for sarcasm; those, on the other hand, who hold that theworld
is by this time old enough to be the best judge concerningthe management
of its own affairs will scrutinise [sic] thismanagement with some closeness
before they venture to satirise[sic] it; nor will they do so for long without
findingjustification for its apparent recklessness; for we must all
fearresponsibility upon matters about which we feel we know butlittle; on
the other hand we must all continually act, and forthe most part
promptly.We do so, therefore, with greatersecurity when we can persuade
both ourselves and others that amatter is already pigeon-holed than if we
feel that we must useour own judgment for the collection, interpretation,
andarrangement of the papers which deal with it.Moreover, ouraction is
God the Known and God the Unknown
4
thus made to appear as if it received collectivesanction; and by so
appearing it receives it.Almost anysettlement, again, is felt to be better
than none, and the morenearly a matter comes home to everyone, the more
important is itthat it should be treated as a sleeping dog, and be let to
lie,for if one person begins to open his mouth, fatal developmentsmay
arise in the Babel that will follow.
It is not difficult, indeed, to show that, instead of havingreason to
complain of the desire for the postponement ofimportant questions, as
though the world were composed mainly ofknaves or fools, such fixity as
animal and vegetable formspossess is due to this very instinct.For if there
had been noreluctance, if there were no friction and vis inertae tobe
encountered even after atheoretical equilibrium had beenupset, weshould
have had no fixed organs nor settled proclivities, but should have been
daily andhourly undergoingProtean transformations,and have still been
throwing outpseudopodia like the amoeba.True, we might have come to
likethis fashion of living as well as our more steady-going system ifwe had
taken to it many millions of ages ago when we were yetyoung; but we
have contracted other habits which have become soconfirmed that we
cannot break with them.We therefore now hatethat which we should
perhaps have loved if we had practised [sic]it.This, however, does not
affect the argument, for our concernis with our likes and dislikes, not with
the manner in whichthose likes and dislikes have come about.The
discovery thatorganism is capable of modification at all has occasioned so
muchastonishment that it has taken the most enlightened part of theworld
more than a hundred years to leave off expressing itscontempt for such a
crude, shallow, and preposterous conception. Perhaps in another hundred
years we shall learn to admire thegood sense, endurance, and thorough
Englishness of organism inhaving been so averse to change, even more
than its versatilityin having been willing to change so much.
Nevertheless, however conservative we may be, and however
muchalive to the folly and wickedness of tampering with
settledconvictions-no matter what they are-without sufficient cause,there
is yet such a constant though gradual change in oursurroundings as
necessitates corresponding modification in ourideas, desires, and
God the Known and God the Unknown
5
actions.We may think that we should like tofind ourselves always in the
same surroundings as our ancestors,so that we might be guided at every
touch and turn by theexperience of our race, and be saved from all self-
communing orinterpretation of oracular responses uttered by the facts
aroundus.Yet the facts will change their utterances in spite of us;and we,
too, change with age and ages in spite of ourselves, soas to see the facts
around us as perhaps even more changed thanthey actually are.It has been
said, "Tempora mutantur nos etmutamur in illis." The passage would have
been no less trueif it had stood, "Nos mutamur et tempora mutantur
innobis." Whether the organism or the surroundings beganchanging first is
a matter of such small moment that the two maybe left to fight it out
between themselves; but, whichever viewis taken, the fact will remain that
whenever the relationsbetween the organism and its surroundings have
been changed, theorganism must either succeed in putting the
surroundings intoharmony with itself, or itself into harmony with
thesurroundings; or must be made so uncomfortable as to be unable
toremember itself as subjected to any such difficulties, and there fore to
die through inability to recognise [sic] its own identityfurther.
Under these circumstances, organism must act in one or other ofthese
two ways: it must either change slowly and continuouslywith the
surroundings, paying cash for everything, meeting thesmallest change with
a corresponding modification so far as isfound convenient; or it must put
off change as long as possible,and then make larger and more sweeping
changes.
Both these courses are the same in principle, the differencebeing only
one of scale, and the one being a miniature of theother, as a ripple is an
Atlantic wave in little; both have theiradvantages and disadvantages, so
that most organisms will takethe one course for one set of things and the
other for another. They will deal promptly with things which they can get
at easily,and which lie more upon the surface; those, however, which
aremore troublesome to reach, and lie deeper, will be handled uponmore
cataclysmic principles, being allowed longer periods ofrepose followed by
short periods of greater activity.
Animals breathe and circulate their blood by a little action manytimes
God the Known and God the Unknown
6
a minute; but they feed, some of them, only two or threetimes a day, and
breed for the most part not more than once ayear, their breeding season
being much their busiest time.It ison the first principle that the
modification of animal forms hasproceeded mainly; but it may be
questioned whether what is calleda sport is not the organic expression of
discontent which hasbeen long felt, but which has not been attended to,
nor been metstep by step by as much small remedial modification as was
foundpracticable: so that when a change does come it comes by way
ofrevolution.Or, again (only that it comes to much the samething), a sport
may be compared to one of those happy thoughtswhich sometimes come
to us unbidden after we have been thinkingfor a long time what to do, or
how to arrange our ideas, and haveyet been unable to arrive at any
conclusion.
So with politics, the smaller the matter the prompter, as ageneral rule,
the settlement; on the other hand, the moresweeping the change that is felt
to be necessary, the longer itwill be deferred.
The advantages of dealing with the larger questions by
morecataclysmic methods are obvious.For, in the first place, allcomposite
things must have a system, or arrangement of parts, sothat some parts shall
depend upon and be grouped round others, asin the articulation of a
skeleton and the arrangement of muscles,nerves, tendons, etc., which are
attached to it.To meddle withthe skeleton is like taking up the street, or the
flooring ofone's house; it so upsets our arrangements that we put it offtill
whatever else is found wanted, or whatever else seems likelyto be wanted
for a long time hence, can be done at the same time. Another advantage is
in the rest which is given to the attentionduring the long hollows, so to
speak, of the waves between theperiods of resettlement.Passion and
prejudice have time to calmdown, and when attention is next directed to
the same question,it is a refreshed and invigorated attention-an
attention,moreover, which may be given with the help of new lights
derivedfrom other quarters that were not luminous when the question
waslast considered.Thirdly, it is more easy and safer to make
suchalterations asexperience has proved to be necessary than toforecast
what is going to be wanted.Reformers are likepaymasters, of whom there
God the Known and God the Unknown
7
are only two bad kinds, those who paytoo soon, and those who do not pay
at all.

CHAPTER II
COMMON GROUND
I HAVE now, perhaps, sufficiently proved my sympathy with
thereluctance felt by many to tolerate discussion upon such asubject as the
existence and nature of God.I trust that I mayhave made the reader feel
that he need fear no sarcasm or levityin my treatment of the subject which
I have chosen.I will,therefore, proceed to sketch out a plan of what I hope
toestablish, and this in no doubtful or unnatural sense, but byattaching the
same meanings to words as those which we usuallyattach to them, and
with the same certainty, precision, andclearness as anything else is
established which is commonlycalled known.
As to what God is, beyond the fact that he is the Spirit and theLife
which creates, governs, and upholds all living things, I cansay nothing.I
cannot pretend that I can show more than othershave done in what Spirit
and the Life consists, which governsliving things and animates them.I
cannot show the connectionbetween consciousness and the will, and the
organ, much less canI tear away the veil from the face of God, so as to
show whereinwill and consciousness consist.No philosopher, whether
Christianor Rationalist, has attempted this without discomfiture; but Ican,
I hope, do two things: Firstly, I can demonstrate, perhapsmore clearly than
modern science is prepared to admit, that theredoes exist a single Being or
Animator of all living things - asingle Spirit, whom we cannot think of
under any meaner name thanGod; and, secondly, I can show something
more of thepersona or bodily expression, mask, and mouthpiece of thisvast
Living Spirit than I know of as having been familiarlyexpressed elsewhere,
or as being accessible to myself or others,though doubtless many works
exist in which what I am going to sayhas been already said.
Aware that much of this is widely accepted under the name
ofPantheism, I venture to think it differs from Pantheism with allthe
difference that exists between a coherent, intelligibleconception and an
incoherent unintelligible one.I shalltherefore proceed to examine the
doctrine called Pantheism, andto show how incomprehensible and
God the Known and God the Unknown
9
valueless it is.
I will then indicate the Living and Personal God about whoseexistence
and about many of whose attributes there is no room forquestion; I will
show that man has been so far made in thelikeness of this Person or God,
that He possesses all itsessential characteristics, and that it is this God who
has calledman and all other living forms, whether animals or plants,
intoexistence, so that our bodies are the temples of His spirit; thatit is this
which sustains them in their life and growth, who isone with them, living,
moving, and having His being in them; inwhom, also, they live and move,
they in Him and He in them; Hebeing not a Trinity in Unity only, but an
Infinity in Unity, anda Unity in an Infinity; eternal in time past, for so
much time atleast that our minds can come no nearer to eternity than
this;eternal for the future as long as the universe shall exist; everchanging,
yet the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever.And Iwill show this with
so little ambiguity that it shall beperceived not as a phantom or
hallucination following upon apainful straining of the mind and a vain
endeavour [sic] to givecoherency to incoherent and inconsistent ideas, but
with the sameease, comfort, and palpable flesh-and-blood clearness with
whichwe see those near to us ; whom, though we see them at the best
asthrough a glass darkly, we still see face to face, even as we areourselves
seen.
I will also show in what way this Being exercises a moralgovernment
over the world, and rewards and punishes us accordingto His own laws.
Having done this I shall proceed to compare this conception ofGod
with those that are currently accepted, and will endeavour[sic] to show
that the ideas now current are in truth efforts tograsp the one on which I
shall here insist.Finally, I shallpersuade the reader that the differences
between the so-calledatheist and the so-called theist are differences rather
aboutwords than things, inasmuch as not even the most prosaic ofmodern
scientists will be inclined to deny the existence of thisGod, while few
theists will feel that this, the naturalconception of God, is a less worthy
one than that to which theyhave been accustomed.

CHAPTER III
PANTHEISM. I
THE Rev. J. H. Blunt, in his "Dictionary of Sects, Heresies,etc.,"
defines Pantheists as "those who hold that God iseverything, and
everything is God."
If it is granted that the value of words lies in the definitenessand
coherency of the ideas that present themselves to us when thewords are
heard or spoken-then such a sentence as "God iseverything and everything
is God" is worthless.
For we have so long associated the word "God" with the idea of
aLiving Person, who can see, hear, will, feel pleasure,displeasure, etc., that
we cannot think of God, and also ofsomething which we have not been
accustomed to think of as aLiving Person, at one and the same time, so as
to connect the twoideas and fuse them into a coherent thought.While we
arethinking of the one, our minds involuntarily exclude the other,and vice
versa; so that it is as impossible for us tothink of anything as God, or as
forming part of God, which wecannot also think of as a Person, or as a
part of a Person, as itis to produce a hybrid between two widely distinct
animals.If Iam not mistaken, the barrenness of inconsistent ideas, and
thesterility of widely distant species or genera of plants andanimals, are
one in principle-sterility of hybrids being due tobarrenness of ideas, and
barrenness of ideas arising frominability to fuse unfamiliar thoughts into a
coherent conception. I have insisted on this at some length in "Life and
Habit," butcan do so no further here.(Footnote: Butler returned to
thissubject in "Luck, or cunning?" which was originally published in1887.
In like manner we have so long associated the word "Person" withthe
idea of a substantial visible body, limited in extent, andanimated by an
invisible something which we call Spirit, that wecan think of nothing as a
person which does not also bring theseideas before us.Any attempt to
make us imagine God as a Personwho does not fulfil [sic] the conditions
which our ideas attachto the word "person," is ipso facto atheistic,
asrendering the word God without meaning, and therefore withoutreality,
God the Known and God the Unknown
11
and therefore non-existent to us.Our ideas are likeour organism, they will
stand a vast amount of modification if itis effected slowly and without
shock, but the life departs out ofthem, leaving the form of an idea without
the power thereof, ifthey are jarred too rudely.
Any being, then, whom we can imagine as God, must have all
thequalities, capabilities, and also all the limitations which areimplied
when the word "person" is used.
But, again, we cannot conceive of "everything" as a person.
"Everything" must comprehend all that is to be found on earth, oroutside
of it, and we know of no such persons as this.When wesay "persons" we
intend living people with flesh and blood;sometimes we extend our
conceptions to animals and plants, but wehave not hitherto done so as
generally as I hope we shall someday come to do.Below animals and
plants we have never in anyseriousness gone.All that we have been able to
regard aspersonal has had what we can call a living body, even though
thatbody is vegetable only; and this body has been tangible, and hasbeen
comprised within certain definite limits, or within limitswhich have at any
rate struck the eye as definite.And every partwithin these limits has been
animated by an unseen somethingwhich we call soul or spirit.A person
must be a persona- that is to say, the living mask and mouthpiece of an
energysaturating it, and speaking through it.It must be animate in allits
parts.
But "everything" is not animate.Animals and plants alone producein us
those ideas which can make reasonable people call them"persons" with
consistency of intention.We can conceive of eachanimal and of each plant
as a person; we can conceive again of acompound person like the coral
polypes [sic], or like a treewhich is composed of a congeries of
subordinate persons,inasmuch as each bud is a separate and individual
plant.We cango farther than this, and, as I shall hope to show, we ought
todo so; that is to say, we shall find it easier and more agreeablewith our
other ideas to go farther than not; for we should seeall animal and
vegetable life as united by a subtle and tilllately invisible ramification, so
that all living things are onetree-like growth, forming a single person.But
we cannot conceiveof oceans, continents, and air as forming parts of a
God the Known and God the Unknown
12
person atall; much less can we think of them as forming one person
withthe living forms that inhabit them.
To ask this of us is like asking us to see the bowl and the waterin
which three gold-fish are swimming as part of the gold-fish. We cannot do
it any more than we can do something physicallyimpossible.We can see
the gold-fish as forming one family, andtherefore as in a way united to the
personality of the parentsfrom which they sprang, and therefore as
members one of another,and therefore as forming a single growth of gold-
fish, as boughsand buds unite to form a tree; but we cannot by any effort
of theimagination introduce the bowl and the water into thepersonality, for
we have never been accustomed to think of suchthings as living and
personal.Those, therefore, who tell us that"God is everything, and
everything is God," require us to see"everything" as a person, which we
cannot; or God as not aperson, which again we cannot.
Continuing the article of Mr.Blunt from which I have alreadyquoted, I
read :-
"Linus, in a passage which has been preserved by Stobaeus,exactly
expresses the notion afterwards adopted by Spinoza: 'Onesole energy
governs all things; all things are unity, and eachportion is All; for of one
integer all things were born; in theend of time all things shall again
become unity; the unity ofmultiplicity.'Orpheus, his disciple, taught no
other doctrine."
According to Pythagoras, "an adept in the Orphic philosophy,""the
soul of the world is the Divine energy which interpenetratesevery portion
of the mass, and the soul of man is an efflux ofthat energy.The world, too,
is an exact impress of the EternalIdea, which is the mind of God."John
Scotus Erigena taught that"all is God and God is all."William of
Champeaux, again, twohundred years later, maintained that "all
individuality is one insubstance, and varies only in its non-essential
accidents andtransient properties." Amalric of Bena and David of
Dinantfollowed the theory out "into a thoroughgoing Pantheism." Amalric
held that "All is God and God is all.The Creator and thecreature are one
Being.Ideas are at once creative and created,subjective and objective.God
is the end of all, and all returnto Him.As every variety of humanity forms
God the Known and God the Unknown
13
one manhood, so theworld contains individual forms of one eternal
essence."Davidof Dinant only varied upon this by "imagining a corporeal
unity. Although body, soul, and eternal substance are three, these threeare
one and the same being."
Giordano Bruno maintained the world of sense to be "a vast
animalhaving the Deity for its living.soul." The inanimate part of theworld
is thus excluded from participation in the Deity, and aconception that our
minds can embrace is offered us instead ofone which they cannot entertain,
except as in a dream,incoherently.But without such a view of evolution as
wasprevalent at the beginning of this century, it was impossible tosee "the
world of sense" intelligently, as forming "a vastanimal."Unless, therefore,
Giordano Bruno held the opinions ofBuffon, Dr.Erasmus Darwin, and
Lamarck, with more definitenessthan I am yet aware of his having done,
his contention must beconsidered as a splendid prophecy, but as little more
than aprophecy.He continues, "Birth is expansion from the one centreof
Life; life is its continuance, and death is the necessaryreturn of the ray to
the centre of light." This begins finely,but ends mystically.I have not,
however, compared the Englishtranslation with the original, and must
reserve a fullerexamination of Giordano Bruno's teaching for another
opportunity.
Spinoza disbelieved in the world rather than in God.He was
anAcosmist, to use Jacobi's expression, rather than an Atheist. According
to him, "the Deity and the Universe are but onesubstance, at the same time
both spirit and matter, thought andextension, which are the only known
attributes of the Deity."
My readers will, I think, agree with me that there is very littleof the
above which conveys ideas with the fluency and comfortwhich
accompany good words.Words are like servants: it is notenough that we
should have them-we must have the most able andwilling that we can find,
and at the smallest wages that willcontent them.Having got them we must
make the best and not theworst of them.Surely, in the greater part of what
has beenquoted above, the words are barren letters only: they do
notquicken within us and enable us to conceive a thought, such as wecan
in our turn impress upon dead matter, and mould [sic] thatmatter into
God the Known and God the Unknown
14
another shape than its own, through the thought whichhas become alive
within us.No offspring of ideas has followedupon them, or, if any at all,
yet in such unwonted shape, andwith such want of alacrity, that we loathe
them as malformationsand miscarriages of our minds.Granted that if we
examine themclosely we shall at length find them to embody a little germ
oftruth-that is to say, of coherency with our other ideas; butthere is too
little truth in proportion to the trouble necessaryto get at it.We can get
more truth, that is to say, morecoherency-for truth and coherency are one-
for less trouble inother ways.
But it may be urged that the beginnings of all tasks aredifficult and
unremunerative, and that later developments ofPantheism may be more
intelligible than the earlier ones. Unfortunately, this is not the case.On
continuing Mr.Blunt'sarticle, I find the later Pantheists a hundredfold
moreperplexing than the earlier ones.With Kant, Schelling, Fichte,and
Hegel, we feel that we are with men who have been decoyedinto a
hopeless quagmire; we understand nothing of theirlanguage-we doubt
whether they understand themselves, and feelthat we can do nothing with
them but look at them and pass themby.
In my next chapter I propose to show the end which the
earlyPantheists were striving after, and the reason and naturalness oftheir
error.
God the Known and God the Unknown
15
CHAPTER IV
PANTHEISM.II
The earlier Pantheists were misled by the endeavour [sic] to layhold of
two distinct ideas, the one of which was a reality thathas since been
grasped and is of inestimable value, the other aphantom which has misled
all who have followed it.The reality isthe unity of Life, the oneness of the
guiding and animatingspirit which quickens animals and plants, so that
they are allthe outcome and expression of a common mind, and are in truth
oneanimal; the phantom is the endeavour [sic] to find the origin ofthings,
to reach the fountain-head of all energy, and thus to laythe foundations on
which a philosophy may be constructed whichnone can accuse of being
baseless, or of arguing in a circle.
In following as through a thick wood after the phantom ourforefathers
from time to time caught glimpses of the reality,which seemed so
wonderful as it eluded them, and flitted backagain into the thickets, that
they declared it must be thephantom they were in search of, which was
thus evidenced asactually existing.Whereon, instead of mastering such of
thefacts they met with as could be captured easily-which facts wouldhave
betrayed the hiding-places of others, and these again ofothers, and so ad
infinitum-they overlooked what waswithin their reach, and followed hotly
through brier and brakeafter an imaginary greater prize.
Great thoughts are not to be caught in this way.They mustpresent
themselves for capture of their own free will, or betaken after a little
coyness only.They are like wealth andpower, which, if a man is not born
to them, are the more likelyto take him, the more he has restrained himself
from an attemptto snatch them.They hanker after those only who have
tamed theirnearer thoughts.Nevertheless, it is impossible not to feel thatthe
early Pantheists were true prophets and seers, though thethings were
unknown to them without which a complete view wasunattainable.What
does Linus mean, we ask ourselves, when hesays :- "One sole energy
governs all things" ? How can one soleenergy govern, we will say, the
reader and the chair on which hesits? What is meant by an energy
God the Known and God the Unknown
16
governing a chair? If by aneffort we have made ourselves believe we
understand somethingwhich can be better expressed by these words than
by any others,no sooner do we turn our backs than the ideas so
painfullycollected fly apart again.No matter how often we go in search
ofthem, and force them into juxtaposition, they prove to have noneof that
innate coherent power with which ideas combine that wecan hold as true
and profitable.
Yet if Linus had confined his statement to living things, and hadsaid
that one sole energy governed all plants and animals, hewould have come
near both to being intelligible and true.For if,as we now believe, all
animals and plants are descended from asingle cell, they must be
considered as cousins to one another,and as forming a single tree-like
animal, every individual plantor animal of which is as truly one and the
same person with theprimordial cell as the oak a thousand years old is one
and thesame plant with the acorn out of which it has grown.This iseasily
understood, but will, I trust, be made to appear simplerpresently.
When Linus says, "All things are unity, and each portion is All;for of
one integer all things were born," it is impossible forplain people-who do
not wish to use words unless they mean thesame things by them as both
they and others have been in thehabit of meaning-to understand what is
intended.How can eachportion be all? How can one Londoner be all
London? I know thatthis, too, can in a way be shown, but the resulting
idea is toofar to fetch, and when fetched does not fit in well enough
withour other ideas to give it practical and commercial value.How,again,
can all things be said to be born of one integer, unlessthe statement is
confined to living things, which can alone beborn at all, and unless a
theory of evolution is intended, suchas Linus would hardly have accepted?
Yet limit the "all things" to "all living things," grant thetheory of
evolution, and explain "each portion is All" to meanthat all life is akin, and
possesses the same essentialfundamental characteristics, and it is
surprising how nearlyLinus approaches both to truth and intelligibility.
It may be said that the animate and the inanimate have the
samefundamental substance, so that a chair might rot and be absorbedby
grass, which grass might be eaten by a cow, which cow might beeaten by a
God the Known and God the Unknown
17
man; and by similar processes the man might become achair; but these
facts are not presented to the mind by sayingthat "one energy governs all
things"-a chair, we will say, and aman; we could only say that one energy
governed a man and achair, if the chair were a reasonable living person,
who wasactively and consciously engaged in helping the man to attain
acertain end, unless, that is to say, we are to depart from allusual
interpretation of words, in which case we invalidate theadvantages of
language and all the sanctions of morality.
"All things shall again become unity" is intelligible as meaningthat all
things probably have come from a single elementarysubstance, say
hydrogen or what not, and that they will return toit; but the explanation of
unity as being the "unity ofmultiplicity" puzzles; if there is any meaning it
is toorecondite to be of service to us.
What, again, is meant by saying that "the soul of the world isthe
Divine energy which interpenetrates every portion of themass" ? The soul
of the world is an expression which, to myself,and, I should imagine, to
most people, is without propriety.Wecannot think of the world except as
earth, air, and water, inthis or that state, on and in which there grow plants
andanimals.What is meant by saying that earth has a soul, andlives?Does
it move from place to place erratically? Does itfeed? Does it reproduce
itself? Does it make such noises, orcommit such vagaries as shall make us
say that it feels? Can itachieve its ends, and fail of achieving them through
mistake? Ifit cannot, how has it a soul more than a dead man has a soul,
outof whom we say that the soul has departed, and whose body
weconceive of as returning to dead earth, inasmuch as it is nowsoulless? Is
there any unnatural violence which can be done toour thoughts by which
we can bring the ideas of a soul and ofwater, or of a stone into
combination, and keep them there forlong together?The ancients, indeed,
said they believed theirrivers to be gods, and carved likenesses of them
under the formsof men ; but even supposing this to have been their real
mind,can it by any conceivable means become our own? Granted that
astone is kept from falling to dust by an energy which compels itsparticles
to cohere, which energy can be taken out of it andconverted into some
other form of energy; granted (which may ormay not be true) also, that the
God the Known and God the Unknown
18
life of a living body is only theenergy which keeps the particles which
compose it in a certaindisposition; and granted that the energy of the stone
may beconvertible into the energy of a living form, and that thus,after a
long journey a tired idea may lag after the sound of suchwords as "the soul
of the world." Granted all the above,nevertheless to speak of the world as
having a soul is notsufficiently in harmony with our common notions, nor
does it gosufficiently with the grain of our thoughts to render
theexpression a meaning one, or one that can be now used with
anypropriety or fitness, except by those who do not know their
ownmeaninglessness.Vigorous minds will harbour [sic] vigorousthoughts
only, or such as bid fair to become so; and vigorousthoughts are always
simple, definite, and in harmony witheveryday ideas.
We can imagine a soul as living in the lowest slime that moves,feeds,
reproduces itself, remembers, and dies.The amoeba wantsthings, knows it
wants them, alters itself so as to try and alterthem, thus preparing for an
intended modification of outsidematter by a preliminary modification of
itself.It thrives ifthe modification from within is followed by the
desiredmodification in the external object; it knows that it is well,and
breeds more freely in consequence.If it cannot get hold ofoutside matter,
or cannot proselytise [sic] that matter andpersuade it to see things through
its own (the amoeba's)spectacles-if it cannot convert that matter, if the
matterpersists in disagreeing with it-its spirits droop, itssoul is disquieted
within it, it becomes listless like awithering flower-it languishes and
dies.We cannot imagine athing to live at all and yet be soulless except in
sleep for ashort time, and even so not quite soulless.The idea of a soul,or
of that unknown something for which the word "soul" is ourhieroglyphic,
and the idea of living organism, unite sospontaneously, and stick together
so inseparably, that no matterhow often we sunder them they will elude
our vigilance and cometogether, like true lovers, in spite of us.Let us not
attempt todivorce ideas that have so long been wedded together.
I submit, then, that Pantheism, even as explained by those whohad
entered on the outskirts only of its great morass,nevertheless holds out so
little hope of leading to anycomfortable conclusion that it will be more
reasonable to occupyour minds with other matter than to follow Pantheism
God the Known and God the Unknown
19
further.ThePantheists speak of a person without meaning a person; they
speakof a" him" and a "he" without having in their minds the idea of
aliving person with all its inevitable limitations.Pantheism is,therefore, as
is said by Mr.Blunt in another article,"practically nothing else than
Atheism; it has no belief in apersonal deity overruling the affairs of the
world, as DivineProvidence, and is, therefore, Atheistic," and again,
"Theismbelieves in a spirit superior to matter, and so does Pantheism;but
the spirit of Theism is self-conscious, and thereforepersonal and of
individual existence-a nature per se, andupholding all things by an active
control; while Pantheismbelieves in spirit that is of a higher nature than
brute matter,but is a mere unconscious principle of life,
impersonal,irrational as the brute matter that it quickens."
If this verdict concerning Pantheism is true-and from all I cangather it
is as nearly true as anything can be said to be whichis predicated of an
incoherent idea-the Pantheistic God is anattempt to lay hold of a truth
which has nevertheless eluded itspursuers.
In my next chapter I will consider the commonly received,orthodox
conception of God, and compare it with the Pantheistic. I will show that it,
too, is Atheistic, inasmuch as, in spite ofits professing to give us a
conception of God, it raises no ideasin our minds of a person or Living

CHAPTER V
ORTHODOX THEISM
We have seen that Pantheism fails to satisfy, inasmuch as itrequires us
to mean something different by the word "God" fromwhat we have been in
the habit of meaning.I have already said-Ifear, too often-that no
conception of God can have any value ormeaning for us which does not
involve his existence as anindependent Living Person of ineffable wisdom
and power,vastness, and duration both in the past and for the future.Ifsuch
a Being as this can be found existing and made evident,directly or
indirectly, to human senses, there is a God.Ifotherwise, there is no God, or
none, at any rate, so far as wecan know, none with whom we need concern
ourselves.No consciouspersonality, no God.An impersonal God is as much
a contradictionin terms as an impersonal person.
Unfortunately, when we question orthodox theology closely, wefind
that it supposes God to be a person who has no material bodysuch as could
come within the range of any human sense, and makean impression upon
it.He is supposed to be of a spiritual natureonly, except in so far as one
part of his triune personality is,according to the Athanasian Creed, "perfect
man, of a reasonablesoul and human flesh subsisting."
Here, then, we find ourselves in a dilemma.On the one hand, weare
involved in the same difficulty as in the case of Pantheism,inasmuch as a
person without flesh and blood, or somethinganalogous, is not a person;
we are required, therefore, tobelieve in a personal God, who has no true
person; to believe,that is to say, in an impersonal person.
This, as we have seen already, is Atheism under another name,being,
as it is, destructive of all idea of God whatever; forthese words do not
convey an idea of something which humanintelligence can understand up
to a certain point, and which itcan watch going out of sight into regions
beyond our view, but inthe same direction-as we may infer other stars in
space beyondthe farthest that we know of; they convey utterly self-
destructive ideas, which can have no real meaning, and can onlybe thought
to have a meaning by ignorant and uncultivated people. Otherwise such
God the Known and God the Unknown
22
foundation as human reason rests upon-that is tosay, the current opinion of
those whom the world appraises asreasonable and agreeable, or capable of
being agreed with for anytime-is sapped; the whole thing tumbles down,
and we may havesquare circles and round triangles, which may be
declared to beno longer absurdities and contradictions in terms, but
mysteriesthat go beyond our reason, without being contrary to it.Few
willmaintain this, and those few may be neglected; an impersonalperson
must therefore be admitted to be nonsense, and animmaterial God to be
Atheism in another shape.
On the other hand, if God is "of a reasonable soul and humanflesh
subsisting," and if he thus has the body without which heis-as far as we are
concerned-non-existent, this body must yet bereasonably like other bodies,
and must exist in some place and atsome time.Furthermore, it must do
sufficiently nearly what allother "human flesh" belonging to "perfect man"
must do, or ceaseto be human flesh.Our ideas are like our organisms; they
havesome little elasticity and circumstance-suiting power, somelittle
margin on which, as I have elsewhere said, side-notes maybe written, and
glosses on the original text; but this power isvery limited.As offspring will
only, as a general rule, varyvery little from its immediate parents, and as it
will faileither immediately or in the second generation if the parentsdiffer
too widely from one another, so we cannot get our idea of- we will say a
horse-to conjure up to our minds the idea of anyanimal more unlike a
horse than a pony is; nor can we get a well- defined idea of a combination
between a horse and any animal moreremote from it than an ass, zebra, or
giraffe.We may, indeed,make a statue of a flying horse, but the idea is one
which cannotbe made plausible to any but ignorant people.So "human
flesh"may vary a little from "human flesh" without undue violence
beingdone to our reason and to the right use of language, but itcannot
differ from it so much as not to eat, drink, nor waste andrepair
itself."Human flesh," which is without these necessaryadjuncts, is human
flesh only to those who can believe in flyinghorses with feathered wings
and bills like birds-that is to say,to vulgar and superstitious persons.
Lastly, not only must the "perfect man," who is the second personof
the Godhead according to the orthodox faith, and who subsistsof "human
God the Known and God the Unknown
23
flesh" as well as of a "reasonable soul," not only mustthis person exist, but
he must exist in some place either on thisearth or outside it.If he exists on
earth, he must be in Europe,Asia, Africa, America, or on some island, and
if he were met withhe must be capable of being seen and handled in the
same way asall other things that can be called perfect man are
seen;otherwise he is a perfect man who is not only not a perfect man,but
who does not in any considerable degree resemble one.It isnot, however,
pretended by anyone that God, the "perfect man," isto be looked for in any
place upon the surface of the globe.
If, on the other hand, the person of God exists in some sphereoutside
the earth, his human flesh again proves to be of anentirely different kind
from all other human flesh, for we knowthat such flesh cannot exist except
on earth; if in spaceunsupported, it must fall to the ground, or into some
otherplanet, or into a sun, or go on revolving round the earth or someother
heavenly body-or not be personal.None of thosewhose opinions will carry
weight will assign a position either insome country on this earth, or yet
again in space, to JesusChrist, but this involves the rendering meaningless
of allexpressions which involve his personality.
The Christian conception, therefore, of the Deity proves
whenexamined with any desire to understand our own meaning (and
whatlawlessness so great as the attempt to impose words upon
ourunderstandings which have no lawful settlement within them?) tobe no
less a contradiction in terms than the Pantheisticconception.It is Atheistic,
as offering us a God which is not aGod, inasmuch as we can conceive of
no such being, nor ofanything in the least like it.It is, like Pantheism,
anillusion, which can be believed only by those who repeat aformula
which they have learnt by heart in a foreign language ofwhich they
understand nothing, and yet aver that they believe it. There are doubtless
many who will say that this is possible, butthe majority of my readers will
hold that no proposition can bebelieved or disbelieved until its nature is
understood.
It may perhaps be said that there is another conception of Godpossible,
and that we may see him as personal, without at thesame time believing
that he has any actual tangible existence. Thus we personify hope, truth,
God the Known and God the Unknown
24
and justice, without intending toconvey to anyone the impression that
these qualities are women,with flesh and blood.Again, we do not think of
Nature as anactual woman, though we call her one; why may we not
conceive ofGod, then, as an expression whereby we personify, by a figure
ofspeech only; the thing that is intended being no person, but ourown
highest ideal of power, wisdom, and duration.
There would be no reason to complain of this if this manner ofusing
the word "God" were well understood.Many words have twomeanings, or
even three, without any mischievous confusion ofthought following.There
can not only be no objection to the useof the word God as a manner of
expressing the highest ideal ofwhich our minds can conceive, but on the
contrary no betterexpression can be found, and it is a pity the word is not
thusmore generally used.
Few, however, would be content with any such limitation of God
asthat he should be an idea only, an expression for certainqualities of
human thought and action.Whence, it may be fairlyasked, did our deeply
rooted belief in God as a Living Personoriginate? The idea of him as of an
inconceivably vast, ancient,powerful, loving, and yet formidable Person is
one which survivesall changes of detail in men's opinion.I believe there
are afew very savage tribes who are as absolutely without religioussense
as the beasts of the field, but the vast majority for along time past have
been possessed with an idea that there issomewhere a Living God who is
the Spirit and the Life of all thatis, and who is a true Person with an
individuality and self- consciousness of his own.It is only natural that we
should beasked how such an idea has remained in the minds of so many -
whodiffer upon almost every other part of their philosophy-for solong a
time if it was without foundation, and a piece of dreamymysticism only.
True, it has generally been declared that this God is an infiniteGod,
and an infinite God is a God without any bounds orlimitations; and a God
without bounds or limitations is animpersonal God; and an impersonal
God is Atheism.But may notthis be the incoherency of prophecy which
precedes the successfulmastering of an idea? May we not think of this
illusoryexpression as having arisen from inability to see the whereaboutsof
a certain vast but tangible Person as to whose existence menwere
God the Known and God the Unknown
25
nevertheless clear? If they felt that it existed, and yetcould not say where,
nor wherein it was to be laid hands on, theywould be very likely to get out
of the difficulty by saying thatit existed as an infinite Spirit, partly from a
desire to magnifywhat they felt must be so vast and powerful, and partly
becausethey had as yet only a vague conception of what they were
aimingat, and must, therefore, best express it vaguely.
We must not be surprised that when an idea is still inchoate
itsexpression should be inconsistent and imperfect-ideas will
almostalways during the earlier history of a thought be put
togetherexperimentally so as to see whether or no they will cohere. Partly
out of indolence, partly out of the desire of those whobrought the ideas
together to be declared right, and partly outof joy that the truth should be
supposed found, incoherent ideaswill be kept together longer than they
should be; neverthelessthey will in the end detach themselves and go, if
others presentthemselves which fit into their place better.There is
noconsistency which has not once been inconsistent, nor coherencythat
has not been incoherent.The incoherency of our ideasconcerning God is
due to the fact that we have not yet trulyfound him, but it does not argue
that he does not exist andcannot be found anywhere after more diligent
search; on thecontrary, the persistence of the main idea, in spite of
theincoherency of its details, points strongly in the direction ofbelieving
that it rests upon a foundation in fact.
But it must be remembered there can be no God who is not
personaland material: and if personal, then, though inconceivably vast
incomparison with man, still limited in space and time, and capableof
making mistakes concerning his own interests, though as ageneral rule
right in his estimates concerning them.Where, then,is this Being? He must
be on earth, or what folly can be greaterthan speaking of him as a person?
What are persons on any otherearth to us, or we to them? He must have
existed and be going toexist through all time, and he must have a tangible
body.Where,then, is the body of this God? And what is the mystery of
hisIncarnation?
It will be my business to show this in the following chapter.
God the Known and God the Unknown
26
CHAPTER VI
THE TREE OF LIFE
Atheism denies knowledge of a God of any kind.Pantheism
andTheism alike profess to give us a God, but they alike fail toperform
what they have promised.We can know nothing of the Godthey offer us,
for not even do they themselves profess that anyof our senses can be
cognisant [sic] of him.They tell us that heis a personal God, but that he has
no material person.This isdisguised Atheism.What we want is a Personal
God, the glory ofwhose Presence can be made in part evident to our senses,
thoughwhat we can realise [sic] is less than nothing in comparison
withwhat we must leave for ever unimagined.
And truly such a God is not far from every one of us; for if wesurvey
the broader and deeper currents of men's thoughts duringthe last three
thousand years, we may observe two great andsteady sets as having
carried away with them the more eligibleraces of mankind.The one is a
tendency from Polytheism toMonotheism; the other from Polytypism to
Monotypism of theearliest forms of life-all animal and vegetable forms
having atlength come to be regarded as differentiations of a
singlesubstance-to wit, protoplasm.
No man does well so to kick against the pricks as to set himselfagainst
tendencies of such depth, strength, and permanence asthis.If he is to be in
harmony with the dominant opinion of hisown and of many past ages, he
will see a single God-impregnatesubstance as having been the parent from
which all living formshave sprung.One spirit, and one form capable of
suchmodification as its directing spirit shall think fit; one souland one
body, one God and one Life.
For the time has come when the two unities so painfully arrivedat must
be joined together as body and soul, and be seen not astwo, but one.There
is no living organism untenanted by theSpirit of God, nor any Spirit of
God perceivable by man apartfrom organism embodying and expressing
it.God and the Life ofthe World are like a mountain, which will present
differentaspects as we look at it from different sides, but which, when
God the Known and God the Unknown
27
wehave gone all round it, proves to be one only.God is the animaland
vegetable world, and the animal and vegetable world is God.
I have repeatedly said that we ought to see all animal andvegetable life
as uniting to form a single personality.I shouldperhaps explain this more
fully, for the idea of a compoundperson is one which at first is not very
easy to grasp, inasmuchas we are not conscious of any but our more
superficial aspects,and have therefore until lately failed to understand that
we areourselves compound persons.I may perhaps be allowed to
quotefrom an earlier work.
"Each cell in the human body is now admitted by physiologists tobe a
person with an intelligent soul, differing from our own morecomplex soul
in degree and not in kind, and, like ourselves,being born, living, and
dying.It would appear, then, as though'we,' 'our souls,' or 'selves,' or
'personalities,' or bywhatever name we may prefer to be called, are but
theconsensus and full- flowing stream of countless sensationsand impulses
on the part of our tributary souls or 'selves,' whoprobably no more know
that we exist, and that they exist as apart of us, than a microscopic insect
knows the results ofspectrum analysis, or than an agricultural labourer [sic]
knowsthe working of the British Constitution; and of whom we know
nomore than we do of the habits and feelings of some class
widelyseparated from our own."-("Life and Habit," p.110.)
After which it became natural to ask the following question :-"Is it
possible to avoid imagining that we may be ourselvesatoms, undesignedly
combining to form some vaster being, thoughwe are utterly incapable of
perceiving this being as a singleindividual, or of realising [sic] the scheme
and scope of our owncombination? And this, too, not a spiritual being,
which, withoutmatter or what we think matter of some sort, is as
completenonsense to us as though men bade us love and lean upon
anintelligent vacuum, but a being with what is virtually flesh andblood and
bones, with organs, senses, dimensions in some wayanalogous to our own,
into some other part of which being at thetime of our great change we
must infallibly re-enter, startingclean anew, with bygones bygones, and no
more ache for ever fromage or antecedents.
"'An organic being,' writes Mr.Darwin, 'is a microcosm, a littleuniverse,
God the Known and God the Unknown
28
formed of a host of self-propagating organismsinconceivably minute and
numerous as the stars in Heaven.'Asthese myriads of smaller organisms
are parts and processes of us,so are we parts and processes of life at large."
A tree is composed of a multitude of subordinate trees, each budbeing
a distinct individual.So coral polypes [sic] form a tree- like growth of
animal life, with branches from which springindividual polypes [sic] that
are connected by a common tissueand supported by a common
skeleton.We have no difficulty inseeing a unity in multitude, and a
multitude in unity here,because we can observe the wood and the
gelatinous tissueconnecting together all the individuals which compose
either thetree or the mass of polypes [sic].Yet the skeleton, whether oftree
or of polype [sic], is inanimate; and the tissue, whether ofbark or gelatine
[sic], is only the matted roots of theindividual buds; so that the outward
and striking connectionbetween the individuals is more delusive than
real.The trueconnection is one which cannot be seen, and consists in
theanimation of each bud by a like spirit-in the community of soul,in "the
voice of the Lord which maketh men to be of one mind inan house"-"to
dwell together in unity"-to take what arepractically identical views of
things, and express themselves inconcert under all circumstances.Provided
this-the true unifierof organism-can be shown to exist, the absence of
gross outwardand visible but inanimate common skeleton is no bar to
oneness ofpersonality.
Let us picture to our minds a tree of which all the woody fibre[sic]
shall be invisible, the buds and leaves seeming to stand inmid-air
unsupported and unconnected with one another, so thatthere is nothing but
a certain tree- like collocation of foliageto suggest any common principle
of growth uniting the leaves.
Three or four leaves of different ages stand living together atthe place
in the air where the end of each bough should be; ofthese the youngest are
still tender and in the bud, while theolder ones are turning yellow and on
the point of falling. Between these leaves a sort of twig-like growth can be
detectedif they are looked at in certain lights, but it is hard to see,except
perhaps when a bud is on the point of coming out.Thenthere does appear
to be a connection which might be calledbranch-like.
God the Known and God the Unknown
29
The separate tufts are very different from one another, so thatoak
leaves, ash leaves, horse-chestnut leaves, etc., are eachrepresented, but
there is one species only at the end of eachbough.
Though the trunk and all the inner boughs and leaves havedisappeared,
yet there hang here and there fossil leaves, also inmid-air; they appear to
have been petrified, without method orselection, by what we call the
caprices of nature; they hang inthe path which the boughs and twigs would
have taken, and theyseem to indicate that if the tree could have been seen
a millionyears earlier, before it had grown near its present size, theleaves
standing at the end of each bough would have been foundvery different
from what they are now.Let us suppose that allthe leaves at the end of all
the invisible boughs, no matter howdifferent they now are from one
another, were found in earliestbudhood to be absolutely indistinguishable,
and afterwards todevelop towards each differentiation through stages
which wereindicated by the fossil leaves.Lastly, let us suppose thatthough
the boughs which seem wanted to connect all the livingforms of leaves
with the fossil leaves, and with countless formsof which all trace has
disappeared, and also with a single root- have become invisible, yet that
there is irrefragable evidence toshow that they once actually existed, and
indeed are existing atthis moment, in a condition as real though as
invisible to theeye as air or electricity.Should we, I ask, under
thesecircumstances hesitate to call our imaginary plant or tree by asingle
name, and to think of it as one person, merely upon thescore that the
woody fibre [sic] was invisible? Should we notesteem the common soul,
memories and principles of growth whichare preserved between all the
buds, no matter how widely theydiffer in detail, as a more living bond of
union than a frameworkof wood would be, which, though it were visible to
the eye, wouldstill be inanimate?
The mistletoe appears as closely connected with the tree on whichit
grows as any of the buds of the tree itself; it is fed uponthe same sap as the
other buds are, which sap-however much it maymodify it at the last
moment-it draws through the same fibres[sic] as do its foster-brothers-why
then do we at once feel thatthe mistletoe is no part of the apple tree? Not
from any want ofmanifest continuity, but from the spiritual difference-
God the Known and God the Unknown
30
from theprofoundly different views of life and things which are taken
bythe parasite and the tree on which it grows-the two arenow different
because they think differently-as long asthey thought alike they were
alike-that is to say they wereprotoplasm-they and we and all that lives
meeting in this commonsubstance.
We ought therefore to regard our supposed tufts of leaves as atree, that
is to say, as a compound existence, each one of whosecomponent items is
compounded of others which are also in theirturn compounded.But the
tree above described is no imaginaryparallel to the condition of life upon
the globe; it is perhapsas accurate a description of the Tree of Life as can
be put intoso small a compass.The most sure proof of a man's identity
isthe power to remember that such and such things happened, whichnone
but he can know; the most sure proof of his remembering isthe power to
react his part in the original drama, whatever itmay have been; if a man
can repeat a performance with consummatetruth, and can stand any
amount of cross-questioning about it, heis the performer of the original
performance, whatever it was. The memories which all living forms prove
by their actions thatthey possess-the memories of their common identity
with a singleperson in whom they meet-this is incontestable proof of
theirbeing animated by a common soul.It is certain, therefore, thatall
living forms, whether animal or vegetable, are in reality oneanimal; we
and the mosses being part of the same vast person inno figurative sense,
but with as much bona fide literaltruth as when we say that a man's finger-
nails and his eyes areparts of the same man.
It is in this Person that we may see the Body of God-and in
theevolution of this Person, the mystery of His Incarnation.
[In "Unconscious Memory," Chapter V, Butler wrote: "In thearticles
above alluded to ("God the Known and God the Unknown") Iseparated the
organic from the inorganic, but when I came torewrite them I found that
this could not be done, and that I mustreconstruct what I had written." This
reconstruction never havingbeen effected, it may be well to quote further
from "UnconsciousMemory" (concluding chapter): "At parting, therefore,
I wouldrecommend the reader to see every atom in the universe as
livingand able to feel and remember, but in a humble way.He must
God the Known and God the Unknown
31
havelife eternal as well as matter eternal; and the life and thematter must
be joined together inseparably as body and soul toone another.Thus he will
see God everywhere, not as those whorepeat phrases conventionally, but
as people who would have theirwords taken according to their most
natural and legitimatemeaning; and he will feel that the main difference
between himand many of those who oppose him lies in the fact that
whereasboth he and they use the same language, his opponents only
halfmean what they say, while he means it entirely...We shallendeavour
[sic] to see the so-called inorganic as living, inrespect of the qualities it
has in common with the organic,rather than the organic as non- living in
respect of thequalities it has in common with the inorganic."]
God the Known and God the Unknown
32
CHAPTER VII
THE LIKENESS OF GOD
In my last chapter I endeavoured [sic] to show that each livingbeing,
whether animal or plant, throughout the world is acomponent item of a
single personality, in the same way as eachindividual citizen of a
community is a member of one state, or aseach cell of our own bodies is a
separate person, or each bud ofa tree a separate plant.We must therefore
see the whole variedcongeries of living things as a single very ancient
Being,of inconceivable vastness, and animated by one Spirit.
We call the octogenarian one person with the embryo of a few daysold
from which he has developed.An oak or yew tree may be twothousand
years old, but we call it one plant with the seed fromwhich it has
grown.Millions of individual buds have come andgone, to the yearly
wasting and repairing of its substance; butthe tree still lives and thrives,
and the dead leaves have lifetherein.So the Tree of Life still lives and
thrives as a singleperson, no matter how many new features it has acquired
duringits development, nor, again, how many of its individual leavesfall
yellow to the ground daily.The spirit or soul of thisperson is the Spirit of
God, and its body-for we know of no soulor spirit without a body, nor of
any living body without a spiritor soul, and if there is a God at all there
must be a body ofGod-is the many-membered outgrowth of protoplasm,
theensemble of animal and vegetable life.
To repeat.The Theologian of to-day tells us that there is a God,but is
horrified at the idea of that God having a body.We saythat we believe in
God, but that our minds refuse to realise[sic] an intelligent Being who has
no bodily person."Wherethen," says the Theologian, " is the body of your
God?" We haveanswered, "In the living forms upon the earth, which,
though theylook many, are, when we regard them by the light of their
historyand of true analogies, one person only." The spiritual
connectionbetween them is a more real bond of union than the
visiblediscontinuity of material parts is ground for separating them inour
thoughts.
God the Known and God the Unknown
33
Let the reader look at a case of moths in the shop-window of
anaturalist, and note the unspeakable delicacy, beauty, and
yetserviceableness of their wings; or let him look at a case ofhumming-
birds, and remember how infinitely small a part of Natureis the whole
group of the animals he may be considering, and howinfinitely small a
part of that group is the case that he islooking at.Let him bear in mind that
he is looking on the deadhusks only of what was inconceivably more
marvellous [sic] whenthe moths or humming-birds were alive.Let him
think of thevastness of the earth, and of the activity by day and
nightthrough countless ages of such countless forms of animal
andvegetable life as that no human mind can form the faintestapproach to
anything that can be called a conception of theirmultitude, and let him
remember that all these forms have touchedand touched and touched other
living beings till they meet backon a common substance in which they are
rooted, and from whichthey all branch forth so as to be one animal.Will he
not in thisreal and tangible existence find a God who is as much more
worthyof admiration than the God of the ordinary Theologian-as He isalso
more easy of comprehension?
For the Theologian dreams of a God sitting above the clouds amongthe
cherubim, who blow their loud uplifted angel trumpets beforeHim, and
humour [sic] Him as though He were some despot in anOriental tale; but
we enthrone Him upon the wings of birds, onthe petals of flowers, on the
faces of our friends, and uponwhatever we most delight in of all that lives
upon the earth.Wethen can not only love Him, but we can do that without
which lovehas neither power nor sweetness, but is a phantom only,
animpersonal person, a vain stretching forth of arms towardssomething
that can never fill them-we can express our love andhave it expressed to us
in return.And this not in the uprearingof stone temples-for the Lord
dwelleth [sic] in temples made withother organs than hands-nor yet in the
cleansing of our hearts,but in the caress bestowed upon horse and dog, and
kisses uponthe lips of those we love.
Wide, however, as is the difference between the orthodoxTheologian
and ourselves, it is not more remarkable than thenumber of the points on
which we can agree with him, and onwhich, moreover, we can make his
God the Known and God the Unknown
34
meaning clearer to himself thanit can have ever hitherto been.He, for
example, says that manhas been made in the image of God, but he cannot
mean what hesays, unless his God has a material body; we, on the other
hand,do not indeed believe that the body of God-the incorporation ofall
life-is like the body of a man, more than we believe each oneof our own
cells or subordinate personalities to be like a man inminiature; but we
nevertheless hold that each of our tributaryselves is so far made after the
likeness of the body corporatethat it possesses all our main and essential
characteristics-thatis to say, that it can waste and repair itself; can feel,
move,and remember.To this extent, also, we-who stand in
meanproportional between our tributary personalities and God-are madein
the likeness of God; for we, and God, and our subordinatecells alike
possess the essential characteristics of life whichhave been above recited.It
is more true, therefore, for us tosay that we are made in the likeness of
God than for the orthodoxTheologian to do so.
Nor, again, do we find difficulty in adopting such an expressionas that
"God has taken our nature upon Him." We hold this asfirmly, and much
more so, than Christians can do, but we say thatthis is no new thing for
Him to do, for that He has taken fleshand dwelt among us from the day
that He first assumed our shape,some millions of years ago, until now.God
cannot become man moreespecially than He can become other living
forms, any more thanwe can be our eyes more especially than any other of
ourorgans.We may develop larger eyes, so that our eyes may come
tooccupy a still more important place in our economy than they doat
present; and in a similar way the human race may become a
morepredominant part of God than it now is-but we cannot admit thatone
living form is more like God than another; we must hold allequally like
Him, inasmuch as they "keep ever," as Buffon says,"the same fundamental
unity, in spite of differences of detail- nutrition, development,
reproduction" (and, I would add,"memory") "being the common traits of
all organic bodies."Theutmost we can admit is, that some embodiments of
the Spirit ofLife may be more important than others to the welfare of Life
asa whole, in the same way as some of our organs are more importantthan
others to ourselves.
God the Known and God the Unknown
35
But the above resemblances between the language which we canadopt
intelligently and that which Theologians use vaguely, seemto reduce the
differences of opinion between the two contendingparties to disputes
about detail.For even those who believetheir ideas to be the most definite,
and who picture tothemselves a God as anthropomorphic as He was
represented byRaffaelle, are yet not prepared to stand by their ideas if
theyare hard pressed in the same way as we are by ours.Those who saythat
God became man and took flesh upon Him, and that He is nowperfect God
and perfect man of a reasonable soul and human fleshsubsisting, will yet
not mean that Christ has a heart, blood, astomach, etc., like man's, which,
if he has not, it is idle tospeak of him as "perfect man." I am persuaded
that they do notmean this, nor wish to mean it; but that they have been led
intosaying it by a series of steps which it is very easy tounderstand and
sympathise [sic] with, if they are considered withany diligence.
For our forefathers, though they might and did feel the existenceof a
Personal God in the world, yet could not demonstrate thisexistence, and
made mistakes in their endeavour [sic] to persuadethemselves that they
understood thoroughly a truth which they hadas yet perceived only from a
long distance.Hence all thedogmatism and theology of many centuries.It
was impossible forthem to form a clear or definite conception concerning
God untilthey had studied His works more deeply, so as to grasp the ideaof
many animals of different kinds and with no apparentconnection between
them, being yet truly parts of one and thesame animal which comprised
them in the same way as a treecomprises all its buds.They might speak of
this by a figure ofspeech, but they could not see it as a fact.Before this
could beintended literally, Evolution must be grasped, and not Evolutionas
taught in what is now commonly called Darwinism, but the oldteleological
Darwinism of eighty years ago.Nor is this againsufficient, for it must be
supplemented by a perception of theoneness of personality between
parents and offspring, thepersistence of memory through all generations,
the latency ofthis memory until rekindled by the recurrence of the
associatedideas, and the unconsciousness with which repeated acts come
tobe performed.These are modern ideas which might be caught sightof
now and again by prophets in time past, but which are even nowmastered
God the Known and God the Unknown
36
and held firmly only by the few.
When once, however, these ideas have been accepted, the
chiefdifference between the orthodox God and the God who can be seenof
all men is, that the first is supposed to have existed fromall time, while the
second has only lived for more millions ofyears than our minds can reckon
intelligently; the first isomnipresent in all space, while the second is only
present in theliving forms upon this earth-that is to say, is only more
widelypresent than our minds can intelligently embrace.The first
isomnipotent and all-wise; the second is only quasi-omnipotent andquasi
all-wise.It is true, then, that we deprive God of thatinfinity which orthodox
Theologians have ascribed to Him, but thebounds we leave Him are of
such incalculable extent that nothingcan be imagined more glorious or
vaster; and in return for thelimitations we have assigned to Him, we render
it possible formen to believe in Him , and love Him, not with their lips
only,but with their hearts and lives.
Which, I may now venture to ask my readers, is the true God-theGod
of the Theologian, or He whom we may see around us, and inwhose
presence we stand each hour and moment of our lives?

CHAPTER VIII
THE LIFE EVERLASTING
Let us now consider the life which we can look forward to
withcertainty after death, and the moral government of the world hereon
earth.
If we could hear the leaves complaining to one another that theymust
die, and commiserating the hardness of their lot in havingever been
induced to bud forth, we should, I imagine, despisethem for their
peevishness more than we should pity them.Weshould tell them that
though we could not see reason for thinkingthat they would ever hang
again upon the same-or any at allsimilar-bough as the same individual
leaves, after they had oncefaded and fallen off, yet that as they had been
changingpersonalities without feeling it during the whole of theirleafhood,
so they would on death continue to do this selfsamething by entering into
new phases of life.True, death willdeprive them of conscious memory
concerning their now currentlife; but, though they die as leaves, they live
in the tree whomthey have helped to vivify, and whose growth and
continued well- being is due solely to this life and death of its
componentpersonalities.
We consider the cells which are born and die within us yearly tohave
been sufficiently honoured [sic] in having contributed theirquotum to our
life; why should we have such difficulty in seeingthat a healthy enjoyment
and employment of our life will give usa sufficient reward in that growth
of God wherein we may livemore truly and effectually after death than we
have lived when wewere conscious of existence?Is Handel dead when he
influencesand sets in motion more human beings in three months now
thanduring the whole, probably, of the years in which he thought thathe
was alive? What is being alive if the power to draw men formany miles in
order that they may put themselves enrapport with him is not being so?
True, Handel no longerknows the power which he has over us, but this is a
small matter;he no longer animates six feet of flesh and blood, but he
livesin us as the dead leaf lives in the tree.He is with God, and Godknows
God the Known and God the Unknown
38
him though he knows himself no more.
This should suffice, and I observe in practice does suffice, forall
reasonable persons.It may be said that one day the treeitself must die, and
the leaves no longer live therein; and so,also, that the very God or Life of
the World will one day perish,as all that is born must surely in the end
die.But they who fretupon such grounds as this must be in so much want
of a grievancethat it were a cruelty to rob them of one: if a man who is
fondof music tortures himself on the ground that one day all
possiblecombinations and permutations of sounds will have been
exhaustedso that there can be no more new tunes, the only thing we can
dowith him is to pity him and leave him; nor is there any bettercourse than
this to take with those idle people who worry them selves and others on
the score that they will one day be unableto remember the small balance of
their lives that they have notalready forgotten as unimportant to them-that
they will one daydie to the balance of what they have not already died to.I
neverknew a well-bred or amiable person who complained seriously ofthe
fact that he would have to die.Granted we must all some times find
ourselves feeling sorry that we cannot remain for everat our present age,
and that we may die so much sooner than welike; but these regrets are
passing with well-disposed people,and are a sine qua non for the existence
of life at all. For if people could live for ever so as to suffer from no
suchregret, there would be no growth nor development in life; if, onthe
other hand, there were no unwillingness to die, people wouldcommit
suicide upon the smallest contradiction, and the racewould end in a
twelvemonth.
We then offer immortality, but we do not offer resurrection fromthe
dead; we say that those who die live in the Lord whether theybe just or
unjust, and that the present growth of God is theoutcome of all past lives;
but we believe that as they live inGod-in the effect they have produced
upon the universal life-whenonce their individual life is ended, so it is God
who knows oftheir life thenceforward and not themselves; and we urge
thatthis immortality, this entrance into the joy of the Lord, thisbeing ever
with God, is true, and can be apprehended by all men,and that the
perception of it should and will tend to make themlead happier, healthier
God the Known and God the Unknown
39
lives; whereas the commonly receivedopinion is true with a stage truth
only, and has little permanenteffect upon those who are best worth
considering.Neverthelessthe expressions in common use among the
orthodox fit in soperfectly with facts, which we must all acknowledge, that
it isimpossible not to regard the expressions as founded upon aprophetic
perception of the facts.
Two things stand out with sufficient clearness.The first is therarity of
suicide even among those who rail at life mostbitterly.The other is the
little eagerness with which those whocry out most loudly for a resurrection
desire to begin their newlife.When comforting a husband upon the loss of
his wife we donot tell him we hope he will soon join her; but we
shouldcertainly do this if we could even pretend we thought the
husbandwould like it.I can never remember having felt or witnessed
anypain, bodily or mental, which would have made me or anyone
elsereceive a suggestion that we had better commit suicide
withoutindignantly asking how our adviser would like to commit
suicidehimself.Yet there are so many and such easy ways of dying
thatindignation at being advised to commit suicide arises more
fromenjoyment of life than from fear of the mere physical pain
ofdying.Granted that there is much deplorable pain in the worldfrom ill-
health, loss of money, loss of reputation, misconduct ofthose nearest to us,
or what not, and granted that in some casesthese causes do drive men to
actual self-destruction, yetsuffering such as this happens to a
comparatively small number,and occupies comparatively a small space in
the lives of those towhom it does happen.
What, however, have we to say to those cases in which sufferingand
injustice are inflicted upon defenceless [sic] people foryears and years, so
that the iron enters into their souls, andthey have no avenger.Can we give
any comfort to such sufferers?and, if not, is our religion any better than a
mockery-a fillingthe rich with good things and sending the hungry empty
away?Canwe tell them, when they are oppressed with burdens, yet
thattheir cry will come up to God and be heard?The questionsuggests its
own answer, for assuredly our God knows ourinnermost secrets: there is
not a word in our hearts but Heknoweth it altogether; He knoweth our
God the Known and God the Unknown
40
down-sitting and ouruprising, He is about our path and about our bed, and
spieth outall our ways; He has fashioned us behind and before, and
"wecannot attain such knowledge," for, like all knowledge when ithas
become perfect, "it is too excellent for us."
"Whither then," says David, "shall I go from thy Spirit, orwhither shall
I go, then, from thy presence?If I climb up intoheaven thou art there; if I
go down into hell thou art therealso.If I take the wings of the morning and
remain in theuttermost parts of the sea; even there also shall thy hand
leadme, and thy right hand shall hold me.If I say peradventure thedarkness
shall cover me, then shall my night be turned into day:the darkness and
light to thee are both alike.For my reinsare thine; thou hast covered me in
my mother's womb.My bonesare not hid from thee: though I be made
secretly and fashionedbeneath in the earth, thine eyes did see my
substance yet beingunperfect; and in thy book were all my members
written, which dayby day were fashioned when as yet there was none of
them.Do Inot hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? and am I not grieved
withthem that rise up against thee? Yea, I hate them right sore, asthough
they were mine enemies." (Psalm CXXXIX.) There is not awordof this
which we cannot endorse with more significance, aswell as with greater
heartiness than those can who look upon Godas He is commonly
represented to them; whatever comfort,therefore, those in distress have
been in the habit of receivingfrom these and kindred passages, we
intensify rather than not.Wecannot, alas! make pain cease to be pain, nor
injustice easy tobear; but we can show that no pain is bootless, and that
there isa tendency in all injustice to right itself; suffering is notinflicted
wilfully, [sic] as it were by a magician who could haveaverted it ; nor is it
vain in its results, but unless we are cutoff from God by having dwelt in
some place where none of our kindcan know of what has happened to us,
it will move God's heart toredress our grievance, and will tend to the
happiness of thosewho come after us, even if not to our own.
The moral government of God over the world is exercised throughus,
who are his ministers and persons, and a government of thisdescription is
the only one which can be observed as practicallyinfluencing men's
conduct.God helps those who help themselves,because in helping
God the Known and God the Unknown
41
themselves they are helping Him.Again, VoxPopuli vox Dei. The current
feeling of our peers is what weinstinctively turn to when we would know
whether such and such acourse of conduct is right or wrong; and so Paul
clenches hislist of things that the Philippians were to hold fast with
thewords, "whatsoever things are of good fame"-that is to say, hefalls back
upon an appeal to the educated conscience of his age. Certainly the wicked
do sometimes appear to escape punishment,but it must be remembered
there are punishments from within whichdo not meet the eye.If these fall
on a man, he is sufficientlypunished; if they do not fall on him, it is
probable we have beenover hasty in assuming that he is wicked.
God the Known and God the Unknown
42
CHAPTER IX
GOD THE UNKNOWN
The reader will already have felt that the panzoistic conceptionof God-
the conception, that is to say, of God as comprising allliving units in His
own single person-does not help us tounderstand the origin of matter, nor
yet that of the primordialcell which has grown and unfolded itself into the
present life ofthe world.How was the world rendered fit for the habitation
ofthe first germ of Life? How came it to have air and water,without which
nothing that we know of as living can exist? Wasthe world fashioned and
furnished with aqueous and atmosphericadjuncts with a view to the
requirements of the infant monad, andto his due development?If so, we
have evidence of design, andif so of a designer, and if so there must be
Some far vasterPerson who looms out behind our God, and who stands in
the samerelation to him as he to us.And behind this vaster and
moreunknown God there may be yet another, and another, and another.
It is certain that Life did not make the world with a view to itsown
future requirements.For the world was at one time red hot,and there can
have been no living being upon it.Nor is itconceivable that matter in which
there was no life-inasmuch as itwas infinitely hotter than the hottest
infusion which any livinggerm can support-could gradually come to be
alive withoutimpregnation from a living parent.All living things that we
knowof have come from other living things with bodies and souls,whose
existence can be satisfactorily established in spite oftheir being often too
small for our detection.Since, then, theworld was once without life, and
since no analogy points in thedirection of thinking that life can spring up
spontaneously, weare driven to suppose that it was introduced into this
world fromsome other source extraneous to it altogether, and if so we
findourselves irresistibly drawn to the inquiry whether the source ofthe life
that is in the world-the impregnator of this earth-maynot also have
prepared the earth for the reception of hisoffspring, as a hen makes an egg-
shell or a peach a stone for theprotection of the germ within it? Not only
are we drawn to theinquiry, but we are drawn also to the answer that the
God the Known and God the Unknown
43
earthwas so prepared designedly by a Person with body and soulwho knew
beforehand the kind of thing he required, and who tookthe necessary steps
to bring it about.
If this is so we are members indeed of the God of this world, butwe are
not his children; we are children of the Unknown andVaster God who
called him into existence; and this in a far moreliteral sense than we have
been in the habit of realising [sic]to ourselves.For it may be doubted
whether the monads are not astruly seminal in character as the procreative
matter from whichall animals spring.
It must be remembered that if there is any truth in the view putforward
in "Life and Habit," and in "Evolution Old and New" (andI have met with
no serious attempt to upset the line of argumenttaken in either of these
books), then no complex animal or plantcan reach its full development
without having already gonethrough the stages of that development on an
infinite number ofpast occasions.An egg makes itself into a hen because it
knowsthe way to do so, having already made itself into a hen millionsand
millions of times over; the ease and unconsciousness withwhich it grows
being in themselves sufficient demonstration ofthis fact.At each stage in
its growth {he chicken is reminded,by a return of the associated ideas, of
the next step that itshould take, and it accordingly takes it.
But if this is so, and if also the congeries of all theliving forms in the
world must be regarded as a single person,throughout their long growth
from the primordial cell onwards tothe present day, then, by parity of
reasoning, the person thuscompounded-that is to say, Life or God-should
have already passedthrough a growth analogous to that which we find he
has takenupon this earth on an infinite number of past occasions; and
thedevelopment of each class of life, with its culmination in thevertebrate
animals and in man, should be due to recollectionby God of his having
passed through the same stages, or nearlyso, in worlds and universes,
which we know of from personalrecollection, as evidenced in the growth
and structure of ourbodies, but concerning which we have no other
knowledgewhatsoever.
So small a space remains to me that I cannot pursue further
thereflections which suggest themselves.A few concludingconsiderations
God the Known and God the Unknown
44
are here alone possible.
We know of three great concentric phases of life, and we are
notwithout reason to suspect a fourth.If there are so many thereare very
likely more, but we do not know whether there are ornot.The innermost
sphere of life we know of is that of our owncells.These people live in a
world of their own, knowing nothingof us, nor being known by ourselves
until very recently.Yet theycan be seen under a microscope; they can be
taken out of us, andmay then be watched going here and there in
perturbation of mind,endeavouring [sic] to find something in their new
environmentthat will suit them, and then dying on finding how
hopelesslydifferent it is from any to which they have been
accustomed.Theylive in us, and make us up into the single person which
weconceive ourselves to form; we are to them a world comprising
anorganic and an inorganic kingdom, of which they considerthemselves to
be the organic, and whatever is not very likethemselves to be the
inorganic.Whether they are composed ofsubordinate personalities or not
we do not know, but we have noreason to think that they are, and if we
touch ground, so tospeak, with life in the units of which our own bodies
arecomposed, it is likely that there is a limit also in an upwarddirection,
though we have nothing whatever to guide us as towhere it is, nor any
certainty that there is a limit at all.
We are ourselves the second concentric sphere of life, we beingthe
constituent cells which unite to form the body of God.Of thethird sphere
we know a single member only-the God of this world;but we see also the
stars in heaven, and know their multitude. Analogy points irresistibly in
the direction of thinking thatthese other worlds are like our own, begodded
and full of life;it also bids us believe that the God of their world is
begottenof one more or less like himself, and that his growth hasfollowed
the same course as that of all other growths we know of.
If so, he is one of the constituent units of an unknown andvaster
personality who is composed of Gods, as our God iscomposed of all the
living forms on earth, and as all thoseliving forms are composed of
cells.This is the Unknown God. Beyond this second God we cannot at
present go, nor should wewish to do so, if we are wise.It is no reproach to
God the Known and God the Unknown
45
a system thatit does not profess to give an account of the origin of
things;the reproach rather should lie against a system which professedto
explain it, for we may be well assured that such a professionwould, for the
present at any rate, be an empty boast.It isenough if a system is true as far
as it goes; if it throws newlight on old problems, and opens up vistas
which reveal a hope offurther addition to our knowledge, and this I believe
may befairly claimed for the theory of life put forward in "Life andHabit"
and "Evolution, Old and New," and for the corollaryinsisted upon in these
pages; a corollary which follows logicallyand irresistibly if the position I
have taken in the above-namedbooks is admitted.
Let us imagine that one of the cells of which we are composedcould
attain to a glimmering perception of the manner in which heunites with
other cells, of whom he knows very little, so as toform a greater
compound person of whom he has hitherto knownnothing at all.Would he
not do well to content himself with themastering of this conception, at any
rate for a considerabletime? Would it be any just ground of complaint
against him on thepart of his brother cells, that he had failed to explain to
themwho made the man (or, as he would call it, the omnipotent
deity)whose existence and relations to himself he had just caught sightof?
But if he were to argue further on the same lines as those onwhich he
had travelled hitherto, and were to arrive at theconclusion that there might
be other men in the world.besidesthe one whom he had just learnt to
apprehend, it would be stillno refutation or just ground of complaint
against him that he hadfailed to show the manner in which his supposed
human race hadcome into existence.
Here our cell would probably stop.He could hardly be expectedto
arrive at the existence of animals and plants differing fromthe human race,
and uniting with that race to form a singlePerson or God, in the same way
as he has himself united withother cells to form man.The existence, and
much more theroundness of the earth itself, would be unknown to him,
except byway of inference and deduction.The only universe which he
couldat all understand would be the body of the man of whom he was
acomponent part.
How would not such a cell be astounded if all that we knowourselves
God the Known and God the Unknown
46
could be suddenly revealed to him, so that not onlyshould the vastness of
this earth burst upon his dazzled view,but that of the sun and of his planets
also, and not only these,but the countless other suns which we may see by
night around us. Yet it is probable that an actual being is hidden from us,
whichno less transcends the wildest dream of our theologians than
theexistence of the heavenly bodies transcends the perception of ourown
constituent cells.
THE END
