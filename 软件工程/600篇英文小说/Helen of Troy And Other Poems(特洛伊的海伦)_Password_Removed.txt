Song
You bound strong sandals on my feet,You gave me bread and wine,
And bade me out, 'neath sun and stars,For all the world was mine.
Oh take the sandals off my feet,You know not what you do; For all my
world is in your arms,My sun and stars are you.

The Rose and the Bee
If I were a bee and you were a rose, Would you let me in when the
gray wind blows? Would you hold your petals wide apart, Would you let
me in to find your heart, If you were a rose?
"If I were a rose and you were a bee, You should never go when you
came to me, I should hold my love on my heart at last, I should close my
leaves and keep you fast, If you were a bee."
Helen of Troy And Other Poems

The Song Maker
I made a hundred little songsThat told the joy and pain of love, And
sang them blithely, tho' I knewNo whit thereof.
I was a weaver deaf and blind;A miracle was wrought for me, But I
have lost my skill to weaveSince I can see.
For while I sang -- ah swift and strange!Love passed and touched me
on the brow, And I who made so many songsAm silent now.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems

Wild Asters
In the spring I asked the daisiesIf his words were true, And the clever
little daisiesAlways knew.
Now the fields are brown and barren,Bitter autumn blows, And of all
the stupid astersNot one knows.

When Love Goes
I
O mother, I am sick of love,I cannot laugh nor lift my head, My bitter
dreams have broken me,I would my love were dead.
"Drink of the draught I brew for thee, Thou shalt have quiet in its
stead."
II
Where is the silver in the rain,Where is the music in the sea, Where is
the bird that sang all dayTo break my heart with melody?
"The night thou badst Love fly away, He hid them all from thee."
Helen of Troy And Other Poems

The Wayfarer
Love entered in my heart one day,A sad, unwelcome guest; But when
he begged that he might stay,I let him wait and rest.
He broke my sleep with sorrowing,And shook my dreams with tears,
And when my heart was fain to sing,He stilled its joy with fears.
But now that he has gone his way,I miss the old sweet pain, And
sometimes in the night I prayThat he may come again.

The Princess in the Tower
I
The Princess sings:
I am the princess up in the towerAnd I dream the whole day thro'Of a
knight who shall come with a silver spearAnd a waving plume of blue.
I am the princess up in the tower,And I dream my dreams by day,But
sometimes I wake, and my eyes are wet,When the dusk is deep and gray.
For the peasant lovers go by beneath,I hear them laugh and kiss,And I
forget my day-dream knight,And long for a love like this.
II
The Minstrel sings:
I lie beside the princess' tower,So close she cannot see my face,And
watch her dreaming all day long,And bending with a lily's grace.
Her cheeks are paler than the moonThat sails along a sunny sky,And
yet her silent mouth is redWhere tender words and kisses lie.
I am a minstrel with a harp,For love of her my songs are sweet,And
yet I dare not lift the voiceThat lies so far beneath her feet.
III
The Knight sings:
O princess cease your dreams awhileAnd look adown your tower's
gray side --The princess gazes far away,Nor hears nor heeds the words I
cried.
Perchance my heart was overbold,God made her dreams too pure to
Helen of Troy And Other Poems

break,She sees the angels in the airFly to and fro for Mary's sake.
Farewell, I mount and go my way,-- But oh her hair the sun sifts thro' -
-The tilts and tourneys wait my spear,I am the Knight of the Plume of
Blue.

When Love Was Born
When Love was born I think he layRight warm on Venus' breast, And
whiles he smiled and whiles would playAnd whiles would take his rest.
But always, folded out of sight,The wings were growing strong That
were to bear him off in flightErelong, erelong.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
11
The Shrine
There is no lord within my heart,Left silent as an empty shrineWhere
rose and myrtle intertwine, Within a place apart.
No god is there of carven stoneTo watch with still approving eyesMy
thoughts like steady incense rise; I dream and weep alone.
But if I keep my altar fair,Some morning I shall lift my headFrom
roses deftly garlanded To find the god is there.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
12
The Blind
The birds are all a-building,They say the world's a-flower, And still I
linger lonelyWithin a barren bower.
I weave a web of fanciesOf tears and darkness spun. How shall I sing
of sunlightWho never saw the sun?
I hear the pipes a-blowing,But yet I may not dance, I know that Love
is passing,I cannot catch his glance.
And if his voice should call meAnd I with groping dim Should reach
his place of callingAnd stretch my arms to him,
The wind would blow between my handsFor Joy that I shall miss, The
rain would fall upon my mouthThat his will never kiss.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
13
Love Me
Brown-thrush singing all day longIn the leaves above me, Take my
love this little song,"Love me, love me, love me!"
When he harkens what you say,Bid him, lest he miss me, Leave his
work or leave his play,And kiss me, kiss me, kiss me!
Helen of Troy And Other Poems

The Song for Colin
I sang a song at dusking timeBeneath the evening star, And Terence
left his latest rhymeTo answer from afar.
Pierrot laid down his lute to weep,And sighed, "She sings for me," But
Colin slept a careless sleepBeneath an apple tree.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
15
Four Winds
"Four winds blowing thro' the sky, You have seen poor maidens die,
Tell me then what I shall do That my lover may be true." Said the wind
from out the south, "Lay no kiss upon his mouth," And the wind from out
the west, "Wound the heart within his breast," And the wind from out the
east, "Send him empty from the feast," And the wind from out the north,
"In the tempest thrust him forth, When thou art more cruel than he, Then
will Love be kind to thee."
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
16
Roundel
If he could know my songs are all for him, At silver dawn or in the
evening glow, Would he not smile and think it but a whim, If he could
know?
Or would his heart rejoice and overflow, As happy brooks that break
their icy rim When April's horns along the hillsides blow?
I may not speak till Eros' torch is dim, The god is bitter and will have
it so; And yet to-night our fate would seem less grim If he could know.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
17
Dew
I dream that he is mine,I dream that he is true, And all his words I
keepAs rose-leaves hold the dew.
O little thirsty rose,O little heart beware, Lest you should hope to
holdA hundred roses' share.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
18
A Maiden
Oh if I were the velvet roseUpon the red rose vine, I'd climb to touch
his windowAnd make his casement fine.
And if I were the little birdThat twitters on the tree, All day I'd sing my
love for himTill he should harken me.
But since I am a maidenI go with downcast eyes, And he will never
hear the songsThat he has turned to sighs.
And since I am a maidenMy love will never know That I could kiss
him with a mouthMore red than roses blow.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
19
"I Love You"
When April bends above meAnd finds me fast asleep, Dust need not
keep the secretA live heart died to keep.
When April tells the thrushes,The meadow-larks will know, And pipe
the three words lightlyTo all the winds that blow.
Above his roof the swallows,In notes like far-blown rain, Will tell the
little sparrowBeside his window-pane.
O sparrow, little sparrow,When I am fast asleep, Then tell my love the
secretThat I have died to keep.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
20
But Not to Me
The April night is still and sweetWith flowers on every tree; Peace
comes to them on quiet feet, But not to me.
My peace is hidden in his breastWhere I shall never be, Love comes
to-night to all the rest, But not to me.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
21
Hidden Love
I hid the love within my heart,And lit the laughter in my eyes, That
when we meet he may not knowMy love that never dies.
But sometimes when he dreams at nightOf fragrant forests green and
dim, It may be that my love crept outAnd brought the dream to him.
And sometimes when his heart is sickAnd suddenly grows well again,
It may be that my love was thereTo free his life of pain.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
22
Snow Song
Fairy snow, fairy snow, Blowing, blowing everywhere,Would that
IToo, could fly Lightly, lightly through the air.
Like a wee, crystal star I should drift, I should blowNear, more near,To
my dear Where he comes through the snow.
I should fly to my love Like a flake in the storm,I should die,I should
die, On his lips that are warm.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
23
Youth and the Pilgrim
Gray pilgrim, you have journeyed far,I pray you tell to me Is there a
land where Love is not,By shore of any sea?
For I am weary of the god,And I would flee from him Tho' I must take
a ship and goBeyond the ocean's rim.
"I know a port where Love is not,The ship is in your hand, Then
plunge your sword within your breastAnd you will reach the land."
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
24
The Wanderer
I saw the sunset-colored sands,The Nile like flowing fire
between,Where Rameses stares forth serene, And Ammon's heavy temple
stands.
I saw the rocks where long ago,Above the sea that cries and
breaks,Bright Perseus with Medusa's snakes Set free the maiden white like
snow.
And many skies have covered me,And many winds have blown me
forth,And I have loved the green bright north, And I have loved the cold
sweet sea.
But what to me are north and south,And what the lure of many
lands,Since you have leaned to catch my hands And lay a kiss upon my
mouth.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
25
I Would Live in Your Love
I would live in your love as the sea-grasses live in the sea, Borne up by
each wave as it passes, drawn down by each wave that recedes; I would
empty my soul of the dreams that have gathered in me, I would beat with
your heart as it beats, I would follow your soulas it leads.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
26
May
The wind is tossing the lilacs,The new leaves laugh in the sun, And the
petals fall on the orchard wall,But for me the spring is done.
Beneath the apple blossomsI go a wintry way, For love that smiled in
AprilIs false to me in May.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
27
Rispetto
Was that his step that sounded on the stair?Was that his knock I heard
upon the door? I grow so tired I almost cease to care,And yet I would that
he might come once more.
It was the wind I heard, that mocks at me, The bitter wind that is more
cruel than he; It was the wind that knocked upon the door, But he will
never knock nor enter more.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
28
Less than the Cloud to the Wind
Less than the cloud to the wind,Less than the foam to the sea, Less
than the rose to the stormAm I to thee.
More than the star to the night,More than the rain to the lea, More than
heaven to earthArt thou to me.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
29
Buried Love
I shall bury my weary LoveBeneath a tree, In the forest tall and
blackWhere none can see.
I shall put no flowers at his head,Nor stone at his feet, For the mouth I
loved so muchWas bittersweet.
I shall go no more to his grave,For the woods are cold. I shall gather as
much of joyAs my hands can hold.
I shall stay all day in the sunWhere the wide winds blow, But oh, I
shall weep at nightWhen none will know.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
30
Song
O woe is me, my heart is sad,For I should never know If Love came by
like any lad,Without his silver bow.
Or if he left his arrows sharpAnd came a minstrel weary, I'd never tell
him by his harpNor know him for my dearie.
"O go your ways and have no fear,For tho' Love passes by, He'll come
a hundred times, my dear,Before your turn to die."
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
31
Pierrot
Pierrot stands in the gardenBeneath a waning moon, And on his lute he
fashionsA little silver tune.
Pierrot plays in the garden,He thinks he plays for me, But I am quite
forgottenUnder the cherry tree.
Pierrot plays in the garden,And all the roses know That Pierrot loves
his music,But I love Pierrot.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
32
At Night
Love said, "Wake still and think of me,"Sleep, "Close your eyes till
break of day," But Dreams came by and smilinglyGave both to Love and
Sleep their way.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
33
Song
When Love comes singing to his heartThat would not wake for me, I
think that I shall know his joyBy my own ecstasy.
And tho' the sea were all between,The time their hands shall meet, My
heart will know his happiness,So wildly it will beat.
And when he bends above her mouth,Rejoicing for his sake, My soul
will sing a little song,But oh, my heart will break.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
34
Love in Autumn
I sought among the drifting leaves,The golden leaves that once were
green, To see if Love were hiding thereAnd peeping out between.
For thro' the silver showers of MayAnd thro' the summer's heavy heat,
In vain I sought his golden headAnd light, fast-flying feet.
Perhaps when all the world is bareAnd cruel winter holds the land, The
Love that finds no place to hideWill run and catch my hand.
I shall not care to have him then,I shall be bitter and a-cold -- It grows
too late for frolickingWhen all the world is old.
Then little hiding Love, come forth,Come forth before the autumn
goes, And let us seek thro' ruined pathsThe garden's last red rose.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
35
The Kiss
I hoped that he would love me,And he has kissed my mouth, But I am
like a stricken birdThat cannot reach the south.
For tho' I know he loves me,To-night my heart is sad; His kiss was not
so wonderfulAs all the dreams I had.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
36
November
The world is tired, the year is old,The little leaves are glad to die, The
wind goes shivering with coldAmong the rushes dry.
Our love is dying like the grass,And we who kissed grow coldly kind,
Half glad to see our poor love passLike leaves along the wind.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
37
A Song of the Princess
The princess has her lovers,A score of knights has she, And each can
sing a madrigal,And praise her gracefully.
But Love that is so bitterHath put within her heart A longing for the
scornful knightWho silent stands apart.
And tho' the others praise and plead,She maketh no reply, Yet for a
single word from him,I ween that she would die.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
38
The Wind
A wind is blowing over my soul,I hear it cry the whole night thro' -- Is
there no peace for me on earthExcept with you?
Alas, the wind has made me wise,Over my naked soul it blew, -- There
is no peace for me on earthEven with you.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
39
A Winter Night
My window-pane is starred with frost,The world is bitter cold to-night,
The moon is cruel and the windIs like a two-edged sword to smite.
God pity all the homeless ones,The beggars pacing to and fro. God
pity all the poor to-nightWho walk the lamp-lit streets of snow.
My room is like a bit of June,Warm and close-curtained fold on fold,
But somewhere, like a homeless child,My heart is crying in the cold.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems

The Metropolitan Tower
We walked together in the duskTo watch the tower grow dimly white,
And saw it lift against the skyIts flower of amber light.
You talked of half a hundred things,I kept each little word you said;
And when at last the hour was full,I saw the light turn red.
You did not know the time had come,You did not see the sudden
flower, Nor know that in my heart Love's birthWas reckoned from that
hour.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems

Gramercy Park
 For W. P.
The little park was filled with peace,The walks were carpeted with
snow, But every iron gate was locked.Lest if we entered, peace would go.
We circled it a dozen times,The wind was blowing from the sea, I only
felt your restless eyesWhose love was like a cloak for me.
Oh heavy gates that fate has lockedTo bar the joy we may not win,
Peace would go out forevermoreIf we should dare to enter in

In the Metropolitan Museum
Within the tiny PantheonWe stood together silently, Leaving the
restless crowd awhileAs ships find shelter from the sea.
The ancient centuries came backTo cover us a moment's space, And
thro' the dome the light was gladBecause it shone upon your face.
Ah, not from Rome but farther still,Beyond sun-smitten Salamis, The
moment took us, till you stoopedTo find the present with a kiss.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
43
Coney Island
Why did you bring me here? The sand is white with snow, Over the
wooden domes The winter sea-winds blow -- There is no shelter
near,Come, let us go.
With foam of icy lace The sea creeps up the sand, The wind is like a
hand That strikes us in the face. Doors that June set a-swing Are bolted
long ago; We try them uselessly -- Alas, there cannot be For us a second
spring;Come, let us go.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
44
Union Square
With the man I love who loves me not,I walked in the street-lamps'
flare; We watched the world go home that nightIn a flood through Union
Square.
I leaned to catch the words he saidThat were light as a snowflake
falling; Ah well that he never leaned to hearThe words my heart was
calling.
And on we walked and on we walkedPast the fiery lights of the picture
shows -- Where the girls with thirsty eyes go byOn the errand each man
knows.
And on we walked and on we walked,At the door at last we said good-
bye; I knew by his smile he had not heardMy heart's unuttered cry.
With the man I love who loves me notI walked in the street-lamps'
flare -- But oh, the girls who can ask for loveIn the lights of Union Square.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
45
Central Park at Dusk
Buildings above the leafless treesLoom high as castles in a dream,
While one by one the lamps come outTo thread the twilight with a gleam.
There is no sign of leaf or bud,A hush is over everything -- Silent as
women wait for love,The world is waiting for the spring.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
46
Young Love
I
I cannot heed the words they say,The lights grow far away and dim,
Amid the laughing men and maidsMy eyes unbidden seek for him.
I hope that when he smiles at meHe does not guess my joy and pain,
For if he did, he is too kindTo ever look my way again.
II
I have a secret in my heartNo ears have ever heard, And still it sings
there day by dayMost like a caged bird.
And when it beats against the bars,I do not set it free, For I am happier
to knowIt only sings for me.
III
I wrote his name along the beach,I love the letters so. Far up it seemed
and out of reach,For still the tide was low.
But oh, the sea came creeping up,And washed the name away, And on
the sand where it had beenA bit of sea-grass lay.
A bit of sea-grass on the sand,Dropped from a mermaid's hair -- Ah,
had she come to kiss his nameAnd leave a token there?
IV
What am I that he should love me, He who stands so far above
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
47
me,What am I? I am like a cowslip turningToward the sky, Where a
planet's golden burning Breaks the cowslip's heart with yearning, What am
I that he should love me,What am I?
V
O dreams that flock about my sleep,I pray you bring my love to me,
And let me think I hear his voiceAgain ring free.
And if you care to please me well,And live to-morrow in my mind, Let
him who was so cold before,To-night seem kind.
VI
I plucked a daisy in the fields,And there beneath the sun I let its silver
petals fall One after one.
I said, "He loves me, loves me not,"And oh, my heart beat fast, The
flower was kind, it let me say"He loves me," last.
I kissed the little leafless stem,But oh, my poor heart knew The words
the flower had said to me,They were not true.
VII
I sent my love a letter,And if he loves me not, He shall not find my
love for himIn any line or dot.
But if he loves me truly,He'll find it hidden deep, As dawn gleams red
thro' chilly cloudsTo eyes awaked from sleep.
VIII
The world is cold and gray and wet, And I am heavy-hearted, yet
When I am home and look to see The place my letters wait for me, If I
should find ONE letter there, I think I should not greatly care If it were
rainy or were fair, For all the world would suddenly Seem like a festival to
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
48
me.
IX
I hid three words within my heart,That longed to fly to him, At dawn
they woke me with a start,They sang till day was dim.
And now at last I let them fly,As little birds should do, And he will
know the first is "I",The others "Love" and "You".
X
Across the twilight's violetHis curtained window glimmers gold; Oh
happy light that round my loveCan fold.
Oh happy book within his hand,Oh happy page he glorifies, Oh happy
little word beneathHis eyes.
But oh, thrice happy, happy IWho love him more than songs can tell,
For in the heaven of his heartI dwell

Sonnets and Lyrics
Primavera Mia
As kings who see their little life-day pass, Take off the heavy ermine
and the crown, So had the trees that autumn-time laid down Their golden
garments on the faded grass, When I, who watched the seasons in the glass
Of mine own thoughts, saw all the autumn's brown Leap into life and don
a sunny gown Of leafage such as happy April has. Great spring came
singing upward from the south; For in my heart, far carried on the wind,
Your words like winged seeds took root and grew, And all the world
caught music from your mouth; I saw the light as one who had been blind,
And knew my sun and song and spring were you.
Soul's Birth
When you were born, beloved, was your soul New made by God to
match your body's flower, And were they both at one same precious hour
Sent forth from heaven as a perfect whole? Or had your soul since dim
creation burned, A star in some still region of the sky, That leaping
earthward, left its place on high And to your little new-born body yearned?
No words can tell in what celestial hour God made your soul and gave it
mortal birth, Nor in the disarray of all the stars Is any place so sweet that
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
50
such a flower Might linger there until thro' heaven's bars, It heard God's
voice that bade it down to earth.
Love and Death
Shall we, too, rise forgetful from our sleep, And shall my soul that lies
within your hand Remember nothing, as the blowing sand Forgets the
palm where long blue shadows creep When winds along the darkened
desert sweep? Or would it still remember, tho' it spanned A thousand
heavens, while the planets fanned The vacant ether with their voices deep?
Soul of my soul, no word shall be forgot, Nor yet alone, beloved, shall we
see The desolation of extinguished suns, Nor fear the void wherethro' our
planet runs, For still together shall we go and not Fare forth alone to front
eternity.
For the Anniversary of John Keats' Death
 (February 23, 1821)
At midnight when the moonlit cypress trees Have woven round his
grave a magic shade, Still weeping the unfinished hymn he made, There
moves fresh Maia like a morning breeze Blown over jonquil beds when
warm rains cease. And stooping where her poet's head is laid, Selene
weeps while all the tides are stayed And swaying seas are darkened into
peace. But they who wake the meadows and the tides Have hearts too kind
to bid him wake from sleep Who murmurs sometimes when his dreams are
deep, Startling the Quiet Land where he abides, And charming still, sad-
eyed Persephone With visions of the sunny earth and sea.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
51
Silence
 (To Eleonora Duse)
We are anhungered after solitude, Deep stillness pure of any speech or
sound, Soft quiet hovering over pools profound, The silences that on the
desert brood, Above a windless hush of empty seas, The broad unfurling
banners of the dawn, A faery forest where there sleeps a Faun; Our souls
are fain of solitudes like these. O woman who divined our weariness, And
set the crown of silence on your art, From what undreamed-of depth
within your heart Have you sent forth the hush that makes us free To hear
an instant, high above earth's stress, The silent music of infinity?
The Return
I turned the key and opened wide the door To enter my deserted room
again, Where thro' the long hot months the dust had lain. Was it not lonely
when across the floor No step was heard, no sudden song that bore My
whole heart upward with a joyous pain? Were not the pictures and the
volumes fain To have me with them always as before? But Giorgione's
Venus did not deign To lift her lids, nor did the subtle smile Of Mona Lisa
deepen.Madeleine Still wept against the glory of her hair, Nor did the
lovers part their lips the while, But kissed unheeding that I watched them
there.
Fear
I am afraid, oh I am so afraid! The cold black fear is clutching me to-
night As long ago when they would take the light And leave the little child
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
52
who would have prayed, Frozen and sleepless at the thought of death. My
heart that beats too fast will rest too soon; I shall not know if it be night or
noon, -- Yet shall I struggle in the dark for breath? Will no one fight the
Terror for my sake, The heavy darkness that no dawn will break? How can
they leave me in that dark alone, Who loved the joy of light and warmth so
much, And thrilled so with the sense of sound and touch, -- How can they
shut me underneath a stone?
Anadyomene
The wide, bright temple of the world I found, And entered from the
dizzy infinite That I might kneel and worship thee in it; Leaving the
singing stars their ceaseless round Of silver music sound on orbed sound,
For measured spaces where the shrines are lit, And men with wisdom or
with little wit Implore the gods that mercy may abound. Ah, Aphrodite,
was it not from thee My summons came across the endless spaces? Mother
of Love, turn not thy face from me Now that I seek for thee in human
faces; Answer my prayer or set my spirit free Again to drift along the
starry places.
Galahad in the Castle of the Maidens
 (To the maiden with the hidden face in Abbey's painting)
The other maidens raised their eyes to him Who stumbled in before
them when the fight Had left him victor, with a victor's right. I think his
eyes with quick hot tears grew dim; He scarcely saw her swaying white
and slim, And trembling slightly, dreaming of his might, Nor knew he
touched her hand, as strangely light As a wan wraith's beside a river's rim.
The other maidens raised their eyes to see And only she has hid her face
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
53
away, And yet I ween she loved him more than they, And very fairly
fashioned was her face. Yet for Love's shame and sweet humility, She
dared not meet him with their queenlike grace.
To an Aeolian Harp
The winds have grown articulate in thee, And voiced again the wail of
ancient woe That smote upon the winds of long ago: The cries of Trojan
women as they flee, The quivering moan of pale Andromache, Now lifted
loud with pain and now brought low. It is the soul of sorrow that we know,
As in a shell the soul of all the sea. So sometimes in the compass of a song,
Unknown to him who sings, thro' lips that live, The voiceless dead of
long-forgotten lands Proclaim to us their heaviness and wrong In sweeping
sadness of the winds that give Thy strings no rest from weariless wild
hands.
To Erinna
Was Time not harsh to you, or was he kind, O pale Erinna of the
perfect lyre, That he has left no word of singing fire Whereby you waked
the dreaming Lesbian wind, And kindled night along the lyric shore? O
girl whose lips Erato stooped to kiss, Do you go sorrowing because of this
In fields where poets sing forevermore? Or are you glad and is it best to be
A silent music men have never heard, A dream in all our souls that we may
say: "Her voice had all the rapture of the sea, And all the clear cool quiver
of a bird Deep in a forest at the break of day"?
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
54
To Cleis
 "I have a fair daughter with a form like a golden flower,Cleis, the
beloved." Sapphic fragment.
When the dusk was wet with dew,Cleis, did the muses nineListen in a
silent line While your mother sang to you?
Did they weep or did they smileWhen she crooned to still your
cries,She, a muse in human guise, Who forsook her lyre awhile?
Did you feel her wild heart beat?Did the warmth of all the sunThro'
your little body run When she kissed your hands and feet?
Did your fingers, babywise,Touch her face and touch her hair,Did you
think your mother fair, Could you bear her burning eyes?
Are the songs that soothed your fearsVanished like a vanished
flame,Save the line where shines your name Starlike down the graying
years?
Cleis speaks no word to me,For the land where she has goneLieth
mute at dusk and dawn Like a windless tideless sea.
Paris in Spring
The city's all a-shiningBeneath a fickle sun, A gay young wind's a-
blowing,The little shower is done. But the rain-drops still are clingingAnd
falling one by one -- Oh it's Paris, it's Paris,And spring-time has begun.
I know the Bois is twinklingIn a sort of hazy sheen, And down the
Champs the gray old archStands cold and still between. But the walk is
flecked with sunlightWhere the great acacias lean, Oh it's Paris, it's
Paris,And the leaves are growing green.
The sun's gone in, the sparkle's dead,There falls a dash of rain, But
who would care when such an airComes blowing up the Seine? And still
Ninette sits sewingBeside her window-pane, When it's Paris, it's Paris,And

spring-time's come again.
Madeira from the Sea
Out of the delicate dream of the distance an emerald emerges Veiled in
the violet folds of the air of the sea; Softly the dream grows awakening --
shimmering white of a city, Splashes of crimson, the gay bougainvillea,
the palms. High in the infinite blue of its heaven a quiet cloud lingers, Lost
and forgotten of winds that have fallen asleep, Fallen asleep to the tune of
a Portuguese song in a garden.
City Vignettes
I Dawn
The greenish sky glows up in misty reds,The purple shadows turn to
brick and stone, The dreams wear thin, men turn upon their beds,And hear
the milk-cart jangle by alone.
II Dusk
The city's street, a roaring blackened streamWalled in by granite, thro'
whose thousand eyes A thousand yellow lights begin to gleam,And over
all the pale untroubled skies.
III Rain at Night
The street-lamps shine in a yellow lineDown the splashy, gleaming
street, And the rain is heard now loud now blurredBy the tread of homing
feet.

By the Sea
Beside an ebbing northern sea While stars awaken one by one, We
walk together, I and he.
He woos me with an easy grace That proves him only half sincere; A
light smile flickers on his face.
To him love-making is an art, And as a flutist plays a flute, So does he
play upon his heart
A music varied to his whim. He has no use for love of mine, He would
not have me answer him.
To hide my eyes within the night I watch the changeful lighthouse
gleam Alternately with red and white.
My laughter smites upon my ears, So one who cries and wakes from
sleep Knows not it is himself he hears.
What if my voice should let him know The mocking words were all a
sham, And lips that laugh could tremble so?
What if I lost the power to lie, And he should only hear his name In
one low, broken cry?
On the Death of Swinburne
He trod the earth but yesterday, And now he treads the stars.He left us
in the April timeHe praised so often in his rhyme, He left the singing and
the lyre and went his way.
He drew new music from our tongue, A music subtly wrought,And
moulded words to his desire,As wind doth mould a wave of fire; From
strangely fashioned harps slow golden tones he wrung.
I think the singing understands That he who sang is still,And Iseult
cries that he is dead, --Does not Dolores bow her head And Fragoletta
weep and wring her little hands?
Helen of Troy And Other Poems

New singing now the singer hears To lyre and lute and harp;Catullus
waits to welcome him,And thro' the twilight sweet and dim, Sappho's
forgotten songs are falling on his ears.
Triolets
I
Love looked back as he took his flight,And lo, his eyes were filled
with tears. Was it for love of lost delight Love looked back as he took his
flight? Only I know while day grew night,Turning still to the vanished
years, Love looked back as he took his flight,And lo, his eyes were filled
with tears.
II (Written in a copy of "La Vita Nuova".For M. C. S.)
If you were Lady BeatriceAnd I the Florentine, I'd never waste my
time like this -- If you were Lady Beatrice I'd woo and then demand a
kiss,Nor weep like Dante here, I ween, If you were Lady BeatriceAnd I
the Florentine.
III (Written in a copy of "The Poems of Sappho".)
Beyond the dim Hesperides,The girl who sang them long ago Could
never dream that over seas, Beyond the dim Hesperides, The wind would
blow such songs as these --I wonder now if she can know, Beyond the dim
Hesperides,The girl who sang them long ago?
IV
Dead leaves upon the streamAnd dead leaves on the air -- All of my
lost hopes seem Dead leaves upon the stream; I watch them in a
dream,Going I know not where, Dead leaves upon the streamAnd dead
leaves on the air.

Vox Corporis
The beast to the beast is calling,And the soul bends down to wait; Like
the stealthy lord of the jungle,The white man calls his mate.
The beast to the beast is calling,They rush through the twilight sweet,
But the soul is a wary hunter,He will not let them meet.
A Ballad of Two Knights
Two knights rode forth at early dawnA-seeking maids to wed, Said one,
"My lady must be fair,With gold hair on her head."
Then spake the other knight-at-arms:"I care not for her face, But she I
love must be a doveFor purity and grace."
And each knight blew upon his hornAnd went his separate way, And
each knight found a lady-loveBefore the fall of day.
But she was brown who should have hadThe shining yellow hair -- I
ween the knights forgot their wordsOr else they ceased to care.
For he who wanted purityBrought home a wanton wild, And when
each saw the other knightI ween that each knight smiled.
Christmas Carol
The kings they came from out the south,All dressed in ermine fine,
They bore Him gold and chrysoprase,And gifts of precious wine.
The shepherds came from out the north,Their coats were brown and
old, They brought Him little new-born lambs --They had not any gold.
The wise-men came from out the east,And they were wrapped in white;
The star that led them all the wayDid glorify the night.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems

The angels came from heaven high,And they were clad with wings;
And lo, they brought a joyful songThe host of heaven sings.
The kings they knocked upon the door,The wise-men entered in, The
shepherds followed after themTo hear the song begin.
And Mary held the little childAnd sat upon the ground; She looked up,
she looked down,She looked all around.
The angels sang thro' all the nightUntil the rising sun, But little Jesus
fell asleepBefore the song was done.
The Faery Forest
The faery forest glimmeredBeneath an ivory moon, The silver grasses
shimmeredAgainst a faery tune.
Beneath the silken silenceThe crystal branches slept, And dreaming
thro' the dew-fallThe cold white blossoms wept.
A Fantasy
Her voice is like clear waterThat drips upon a stone In forests far and
silentWhere Quiet plays alone.
Her thoughts are like the lotusAbloom by sacred streams Beneath the
temple archesWhere Quiet sits and dreams.
Her kisses are the rosesThat glow while dusk is deep In Persian garden
closesWhere Quiet falls asleep.
A Minuet of Mozart's
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
60
Across the dimly lighted roomThe violin drew wefts of sound,Airily
they wove and wound And glimmered gold against the gloom.
I watched the music turn to light,But at the pausing of the bow,The
web was broken and the glow Was drowned within the wave of night.
Twilight
Dreamily over the roofsThe cold spring rain is falling, Out in the
lonely treeA bird is calling, calling.
Slowly over the earthThe wings of night are falling; My heart like the
bird in the treeIs calling, calling, calling.
The Prayer
My answered prayer came up to me,And in the silence thus spake he:
"O you who prayed for me to come,Your greeting is but cold and dumb."
My heart made answer:"You are fair,But I have prayed too long to care.
Why came you not when all was new,And I had died for joy of you."
Two Songs for a Child
I Grandfather's Love
They said he sent his love to me,They wouldn't put it in my hand, And
when I asked them where it wasThey said I couldn't understand.
I thought they must have hidden it,I hunted for it all the day, And when
I told them so at nightThey smiled and turned their heads away.
They say that love is something kind,That I can never see or touch. I
wish he'd sent me something else,I like his cough-drops twice as much.
II The Kind Moon
I think the moon is very kindTo take such trouble just for me. He came
along with me from homeTo keep me company.
He went as fast as I could run;I wonder how he crossed the sky? I'm
sure he hasn't legs and feetOr any wings to fly.
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
61
Yet here he is above their roof;Perhaps he thinks it isn't right For me to
go so far alone,Tho' mother said I might.
 On the Tower
Under the leaf of many a Fable lies the Truth for those who look for it.
Jami.
 On the Tower
(A play in one act.)
The Knight. The Lady.
Voices of men and women on the ground at the foot of the tower. The
voice of the Knight's Page.
 The top of a high battlemented tower of a castle.A stone ledge,which
serves as a seat, extends part way around the parapet.Small clouds float by
in the blue sky, and occasionally a swallow passes.Entrance R. from an
unseen stairway which is supposed to extend aroundthe outside of the
tower.
 The Lady (unseen).Oh do not climb so fast, for I am faintWith
looking down the tower to where the earthLies dreaming in the sun.I fear
to fall.
The Knight (unseen).Lean on me, love, my love, and look not down.
L.Call me not "love", call me your conquered foe,That now, since you
have battered down her gates,Gives you the keys that lock the highest
towerAnd mounts with you to prove her homage true;Oh bid me go no
farther lest I fall,My foot has slipped upon the rain-worn stones,Why are
the stairs so narrow and so steep?Let us go back, my lord.
K.Are you afraid,Who were so dauntless till the walls gave
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
62
way?Courage, my sweet.I would that I could climbA thousand times by
wind-swept stairs like these,That lead so near to heaven.
L.Sir, you may,You are a knight and very valorous;I am a woman.I
shall never comeThis way but once.(The Knight and the Lady appear on
the top of the tower.)
K.Kiss me at last, my love.
L.Oh, my sweet lord, I am too tired to kiss.Look how the earth is like
an emerald,With rivers veined and flawed with fallow fields.
K.(Lifting her veil)Then I kiss you, a thousand thousand kissesFor all
the days ere I had won to youBeyond the walls and gates you barred so
close.Call me at last your love, your castle's lord.
L.(After a pause)I love you.
 (She kisses him.Her veil blows away like a white butterflyover the
parapet.Faint cries and laughter from men and womenunder the tower.)
Men and Women.The veil, the lady's veil!
 (The knight takes the lady in his arms.)
L.My lord, I pray you loose me from your armsLest that my people see
how much we love.
K.May they not see us?All of them have loved.
L.But you have been an enemy, my lord,With walls between us and
with moss-grown moats,Now on a sudden must I kiss your mouth?I who
was taught before I learned to speakThat all my house was hostile unto
yours,Now can I put my head against your breastHere in the sight of all
who choose to come?
K.Are we not past the caring for their eyesAnd nearer to the heaven
than to earth?Look up and see.
L.I only see your face.
 (She touches his hair with her hands.Murmuring under the tower.)
K.Why came we here in all the noon-day lightWith only darting
swallows over usTo make a speck of darkness on the sun?Let us go down
where walls will shut us round.Your castle has a hundred quiet halls,A
hundred chambers, where the shadows lieOn things put by, forgotten long
ago.Forgotten lutes with strings that Time has slackened,We two shall
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
63
draw them close and bid them sing --Forgotten games, forgotten books
still openWhere you had laid them by at vesper-time,And your embroidery,
whereon half-workedWeeps Amor wounded by a rose's thorn.Shall I not
see the room in which you slept,Palpitant still and breathing of your
thoughts,Where maiden dreams adown the ways of sleepSwept noiselessly
with damosels and knightsTo tourneys where the trumpet made no
sound,Blow as he might, the scarlet trumpeter,And were the dreams not
sometimes brimmed with tearsThat waked you when the night was
loneliest?Will you not bring me to your oratoryWhere prayers arose like
little birds set freeStill upward, upward without sound of flight?Shall I not
find your turrets toward the north,Where you defied white winter armed
for war;Your southern casements where the sun blows inBetween the leaf-
bent boughs the wind has lifted?Shall we not see the sunrise toward the
east,Watch dawn by dawn the rose of day unfoldingIts golden-hearted
beauty sovereignly;And toward the west look quietly at evening?Shall I
not see all these and all your treasures?In carven coffers hidden in the
darkHave you not laid a sapphire lit with flameAnd amethysts set round
with deep-wrought gold,Perhaps a ruby?
L.All my gems are yoursAnd all my chambers curtained from the
sun.My lord shall see them all, in time, in time.
(The sun begins to sink.)
K.Shall I not see them now?To-day, to-night?
L.How could I show you in one day, my lord,My castle and my
treasures and my tower?Let all the days to come suffice for thisSince all
the past days made them what they are.You will not be impatient, my
sweet lord.Some of the halls have long been locked and barred,And some
have secret doors and hard to findTill suddenly you touch them
unawares,And down a sable way runs silver light.We two will search
together for the keys,But not to-day.Let us sit here to-day,Since all is yours
and always will be yours.
 (The stars appear faintly one by one.)
K.(After a pause.)I grow a little drowsy with the dusk.
L.(Singing.) There was a man that loved a maid, (Sleep and take your
Helen of Troy And Other Poems
64
rest) Over her lips his kiss was laid, Over her heart, his breast.
 (The knight sleeps.)
All of his vows were sweet to hear, Sweet was his kiss to take; Why
was her breast so quick to fear, Why was her heart, to break?
Why was the man so glad to woo? (Sleep and take your rest) Why
were the maiden's words so few ----
 (She sees that he is asleep, and slipping off her long cloak-likeouter
garment, she pillows his head upon it against the parapet,and half kneeling
at his feet she sings very softly:)
I love you, I love you, I love you, I am the flower at your feet, The
birds and the stars are above you, My place is more sweet.
The birds and the stars are above you, They envy the flower in the
grass, For I, only I, while I love you Can die as you pass.
 (Light clouds veil the stars, growing denser constantly.The castle bell
rings for vespers, and rising, the lady movesto a corner of the parapet and
kneels there.)
L.Ave Maria! gratia plena, Dominus ----
Voice of the Page (from the foot of the tower.)My lord, my lord, they
call for you at court!
 (The knight wakes.It is now quite dark.)
 There is a tourney toward; your enemyHas challenged you.My lord,
make haste to come!
 (The knight rises and gropes his way toward the stairs.)
K.I will make haste.Await me where you are.
 (To himself.)There was a lady on this tower with me ----
 (He glances around hurriedly but does not see her in the darkness.)
Page.My lord has far to ride before the dawn!
K.(To himself.)Why should I tarry?
 (To the page.)Bring my horse and shield!
 (He descends.As the noise of his footfall on the stairs dies away,the
lady gropes toward the stairway, then turns suddenly, and going tothe
ledge where they have sat, she throws herself over the parapet.)
 CURTAIN.

Sara Teasdale
Sara Teasdale was born in St. Louis, Missouri, where she attended a
school that was founded by the grandfather of another great poet from St.
Louis -- T. S. Eliot.She later associated herself more with New York City.
Her first book of poems was "Sonnets to Duse" (1907), but "Helen of
Troy" (1911) was the true launch of her career, followed by "Rivers to the
Sea" (1915), "Love Songs" (1917), "Flame and Shadow" (1920) and
more.Her final volume, "Strange Victory", is considered by many to be
predictive of her suicide.
It is interesting to note that in Teasdale's Collected Works, about half
of the poems in this volume -- some more justly than others -- have been
excluded, and most of the rest have been slightly changed. Most of the
poems from this volume which were selected to be included in "Love
Songs" also had some minor changes.This edition preserves the original
readings, but they are not to be considered authoritative.
